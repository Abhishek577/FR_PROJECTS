"LS clears changes in FCRA, Aadhaar must for NGOs now","  The Lok Sabha on Monday passed the amendments to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 that seek to make Aadhaar mandatory for NGOs to receive foreign funds. The amendments aim to streamline the provisions of the FCRA by strengthening the compliance mechanism and enhancing transparency and accountability in the receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution worth thousands of crores of rupees every year, said MoS Home Affairs Nityanand Rai. The amendments will limit the use of foreign funds received under FCRA for administrative purposes from the current limit of 50% to 20%. Also, Aadhaar card will be mandatory for all office bearers of NGOs and other organisations which are seeking funds from foreign sources. “The annual inflow of foreign contribution has almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019, but many recipients of foreign contribution have not utilised the same for the purpose for which they were registered or granted prior permission under the said Act. Many of them were also found wanting in ensuring basic statutory compliances such as submission of annual returns and maintenance of proper accounts,” the proposed amendment States. “This has led to a situation where the Central Government had to cancel certificates of registration of more than 19,000 recipient organisations, including non-governmental organisations, during the period between 2011 and 2019,” it added.

Opp behaviour in Rajya Sabha ‘very shameful’: Govt,"  Asserting that it had a clear majority in the Rajya Sabha during the passage of the farm Bills, the Government on Monday described the behaviour of Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha as “very shameful and irresponsible” as also their refusal to leave the house despite  the Chairman’s order to suspend them on Monday. The Government also pointed out that there is enough visual evidence that the Deputy Chairman would have been nearly physically assaulted had the Marshals not protected him. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the conduct of leaders of opposition parties was “illegal” and violative of all parliamentary norms and rules and accused the Congress of double standards on the issues including contract farming. “The Government had a clear majority yesterday, 110 present members were supporting the Agriculture Bills and only 72 were opposing. We had a decisive majority...their agenda was to stop the House (Rajya Sabha) from passing the Bills,” Prasad maintained. On the Opposition’s claim that the bills were passed without voting on Sunday, Prasad said the deputy chairman had asked the members of Parliament (MPs), who went to the well of the house, to return to their seats 13 times.  He said discussion went on peacefully from 9.30 am to 1.30 pm and after that the deputy-speaker said “you want it to go to select committee, I have to put it to motion and please, go back on your seats”. “How can voting take place when you won’t go to your seats,” he asked. Pointing to the possibility of the chairman being physically attacked, the Union minister said, “Yesterday was a shameful day in parliament history. Mic was broken, a leader of a party tore a rule book” and the chair came “very close to being physically hurt”. “But for Marshalls, some physical hurt was possible”, he sought to say adding there is enough visual evidence if Marshallls would have not protected the Deputy Chairperson , he would have been nearly physically assaulted. He said following their suspension the opposition members had no right to stay back in the house which they did on Sunday.  He said once suspension is ordered there is no discussion allowed and members have to exit the house.  ",india

"NCB LIKELY TO QUIZ ACTRESSES SARA, RAKUL, DESIGNER SIMONE","  Amid the likelihood of Bollywood actresses Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet Singh Singh and fashion designer Simone Khambatta being summoned by it for questioning later this week, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday questioned Suashant’s talent manager Jaya Saha in connection with the ongoing drug case related to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. On a day the informed sources in the investigating confirmed that they would record the statements of Sara, Rahul and Simone under section 67 of the The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, the NCB officials questioned grilled Saha for more than four hours on Monday.  He has been called for questioning once again on Tuesday. Sushant’s ex-manager Shruti Modi will also be questioned by the NCB officials on Tuesday. It may be recalled that Jaya Saha’s name had figured in the WhatsApp chats recovered by the ED from actress Rhea Chakraborty’s mobile phone that reveal that the actress might have been involved in drug dealings. The recovered WhatsApp chats among Rhea, her brother Showik Chakraborty, Sushant’s house manager Samuel Miranda, house staff Dipesh Sawant and Saha had thrown sufficient hints about their alleged involvement in the procurement and use of drugs for Sushant. Though a section of the electronic media was mentioning that actress Shraddha Kapoor would also be called for questioning along with Sara and others, there was no confirmation to that effect from the NCB. Sources said that the NCB would question Sara, Rakul and Simone on the basis of Rhea’s statement recorded by the NCB. The three were among others who used to have drug parties at Sushant’s farm house at Lonavla near Pune.  Rhea had reportedly told the investigators It may be recalled that NCB’s deputy director (operations) KPS Malhotra had on September 14 confirmed that the names Sara , Rakul and Simone had figured in the Sushant Singh Raput death-related drug case. “There has been an issue that whether the name of Sara, Simone and Rakul surfaced during the investigation…the answer to that is yes,” Malhotra had said, while talking to media persons. As many as 16 persons have so far been arrested in the Sushant Singh Raput death-related drug case registered by the NCB. Actress Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik are two of the arrested accused in the case. A descendent of the Tagore and Pataudi families, Sara (25) is the daughter of actor Saif Ali Khan and his first wife Amrita Singh and grand-daughter of  late Indian cricket captain MAK Pataudi and actor and former Censor Board chairperson Sharmila Tagore. Sushant and Sara had worked together in the 2018 film Kedarnath, a Hindi romantic drama. Rakul Preet (29) has acted in several Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films, while Simone (29) is a fashion designer and social media influencer. Unconfirmed reports had earlier said that during the course of her prolonged questioning by the NCB ahead of her arrest on September 8, actress Rhea Chakraborty had reportedly told the investigators that actress Sara Ali Khan and Rakul Preet, designer Simone Khambatta, Sushant's friend and former manager Rohini Iyer and filmmaker Mukesh Chhabra consumed narcotics substances. However, Rhea – after her arrest – Rhea has retracted her statement. Meanwhile, the questioning of the Jaya Saha by the NCB should be seen in the context of the WhatsApp chats recovered by the ED.   In one of the chats between Rhea and Gaurav Arya who is allegedly a drug dealer, Rhea writes: “In case we speak about hard drugs, I haven’t been doing too much. Tried MDMA once”. In another message sent to Gaurav Arya, she asks: “You have MD?”  One message sent to her by one Jaya Saha on November 25 last year says, “Use 4 drops in coffee, tea or water and let him sip it. Give it 30-40 minutes for it to kick in.”  Then, there emerges a message in a chat between Rhea & Jaya Saha: “I have asked him to coordinate with Shruti (Modi) & reach it up”. In yet another message, Rhea writes to  Jaya Saha “Thank you so much” Reply from Jaya:  “No problem bro, hope it helps”. In the first chat message, Miranda writes to Rhea” “Hi Rhea, the stuff is almost over”. In the next message, Jaya Saha tells Rhea:  ‘Use 4 drops in tea, let him sip it …. Give it 30-40 mins to kick in’.  In the seventh and last accessed chat message, Miranda writes to Rhea: “‘Should we take it from Showik’s friend? But he has just hash & bud’, The WA chat messages hint at the fact that Rhea was allegedly procuring drugs for use. The one message sent to Rhea by Jaya Saha on November 25 last year had indirectly hinted that she was allegedly mixing the drug in coffee, tea or water and giving it to Sushant.  ",india

Didi calls Opp to unite against ‘Hitler Raj’,"  Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has reacted to the alleged “forced passing” of the farmers’ Bills by comparing the BJP Government with “Hitler Raj” and said that her party Trinamool Congress will start an indefinite agitation demanding a rollback of the “draconian law.” Saying that “yesterday will be remembered as a Black Sunday” in the history of parliamentary democracy in India Banerjee on Monday said, “the forced passage of the Bills in Rajya Sabha only reminds one of the Hitler Raj … it is dictatorship at its peak,” adding her party would however not take things lying down and begin a prolonged movement against the “draconian law.” Even as two TMC MPs Derek O’ Brien and Dola Sen were suspended from attending this session of the Rajya Sabha Banerjee said “no amount of coercion will deter us. We will not bow our head before this dictatorial Government,” adding “the way the Bills were passed in the Upper House by sheer physical force has made our heads hang in shame. We feel disturbed and ashamed. “I condemn the yesterday’s incident in the Rajya Sabha … the way the Bills were forcibly passed without following the norms. Now it is clear that this Government is not only attacking the opponents but also the farmers and daily wagers … The farmers’ independence is being hijacked they are being made powerless… The day is not far when we will face a food crisis. India is now staring at a famine.” Apprehending that the proposed labour reforms could bring untold hardship for the country’s work force Banerjee said the Government’s proposals for labour reforms would come as a bolt on the work force. Calling for a broad-based opposition unity, Banerjee said, “a time has come when all the parties should unite against this dictatorial government which systematically destroying all the democratic institutions of the country … if need be the Trinamool Congress will remain at the rear of the movement but the parties should come forward to join hands against this Government.” Attacking the Centre for destroying democracy Banerjee said “the situation is such that all the voices of decent are ruthlessly suppressed. If you raise your voice they will implicate youu in false cases. They will send government agencies (read CBI, ED) at your place to coerce you into inaction. This cannot go on for long and the opposition parties must unite and protest to save the Indian democracy.” The TMC would start a ceaseless movement from Tuesday she said. “Our party will hit the streets against the draconian anti-farmer law we will begin with a sit-in agitation followed by multiple rallies both in Kolkata and regions,” Banerjee said.

Stubble burning can exacerbate Covid situation in north: Expert,"  The stubble burning which is likely to start later this month ahead of the Rabi crop sowing season can exacerbate the Coronavirus crisis, an agricultural-cum-environment expert has cautioned. “If alternate arrangements to stubble burning are not made, pollutants like particulate matters and toxic gases like Carbon Monoxide and Methane could give rise to severe respiratory problems, which will further worsen the COVID 19 situation, as the Coronavirus also impacts the respiratory tract,"" Sanjeev Nagpal, also an advisor to the Union and the Punjab governments on the crop residue management, told PTI on Sunday. ""Last year, nearly 50,000 cases of stubble burning were reported in Punjab. Stubble burning contributes about 18 to 40 per cent of particulate matter to atmosphere in northern plains. It also emits large amounts of toxic pollutants like Methane, Carbon Monoxide and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,” said Nagpal, also the MD of Sampurn Agri Ventures Pvt Ltd (SAVPL). Last year''s stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana had contributed to 44 percent of the pollution in NCR Delhi, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Ministry of Earth Science. Nagpal said stubble burning causes not only massive air pollution but also affects the soil health, which is already in a bad shape in Punjab. The practice of stubble burning combined with excessive use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers over the years has resulted in the decrease of soluble silica, carbon and other essential nutrients in the soil, he said. ""Silicon (Si) is one of the most prevalent soil macro-elements, performing an essential function in healing plants in response to environmental stress. The loss of soluble silica in the soil has given rise to silica deficiency in humans exposing people to a greater threat of COVID 19 and other diseases.” Nagpal said. “Insufficient amounts of silica in humans reduce their immune response towards viruses and pathogens,"" he added. Punjab alone produces over 55 metric tons of crop residues each year out of which over 40 per cent have been found surplus, he said. Nagpal said the resolution lies in large scale collection of crop residue from farmers at a price by various plants and state governments, its storage, and then using technology for its conversion into organic manure and also biogas. Nagpal''s SAVPL project in Punjab''s Fazilka has devised this technology in association with IIT and PAU, Ludhiana. The project had purchased about 10,000 MTs of paddy straw last year which benefitted around 500 farmers, he claimed. The plant is making 8 MTs of silica manure per day now against a total capacity of 25 MTs per day, he said, adding the capacity of the project is to process 15,000 MTs of crop residue every year. “Our concept is to process stubble to make silica-rich manure that will improve soil health and food quality thereby improving people''s health. We want the Punjab government to give a fillip to the model of ''crop residue management through its conversion into manure so that it is replicated across the state,” said Nagpal. “This will not only solve the stubble burning problem but will also help produce healthy food thereby helping farmers get better prices for quality food and consumers a chance to buy directly from farmers at a reasonable price,” he said.

World's longest high-altitude tunnel fully ready to open in Himachal,"  The world''s longest high-altitude tunnel on Manali-Leh national highway is fully ready to open in Himachal Pradesh''s Lahaul-Spiti district, a senior Border Road Organisation (BRO) official said on Sunday. The 9-km Atal tunnel built at an altitude of about 10,000 feet above sea level in Lahaul Spiti''s Rohtang is likely to be formally inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in coming weeks, said BRO Chief Engineer, Brigadier K P Purshothaman. ''We are ready for its opening anytime after September 25. PM may open it in the last week of this month or first week of the next month,” Brig K P Purshothaman told PTI. No official confirmation has been received so far, we may get it within a couple of days, he said, adding it is also not yet clear if it would be a virtual opening due to the corona crisis or a physical one. The Atal Tunnel built at a cost of about Rs 3,500 crore is extremely significant from the defence point of view. This will not only shorten the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km but will also be beneficial for the residents of Lahaul-Spiti especially during the winter, a state official spokesperson said. Once thrown open, the tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity to remote border areas of Himachal Pradesh''s Lahaul-Spiti and Leh-Ladakh which otherwise remain cut-off from the rest of the country for about six months due to heavy snowfall during winters, he added. The BRO worked relentlessly to overcome major geological, terrain and weather challenges that included the most difficult stretch of the 587-metre Seri Nalah Fault zone. The breakthrough from both ends was achieved on October 15, 2017. Brig Purshothaman said the tunnel provides a telephone facility at every 150 metre of its stretch, a fire hydrant every 60 metre, emergency exits every 500 metre, turning cavern every 2.2 km, air quality monitors every one km, broadcasting system and automatic incident detection system with CCTV cameras every 250 metre. It is a 10.5-metre wide single tube bi-lane tunnel with a fire proof emergency egress tunnel built into the main tunnel itself. The historic decision to construct the strategic tunnel below the Rohtang pass was taken on June 3, 2000 when late Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister. The foundation stone for the access road to the south portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002.

Arrest of Al Qaeda terrorist leaves Perumbavoor in shock,"  Perumbavoor in Kerala’s Ernakulam district is yet to get over the shock of hearing the news that an Al Qaeda terrorist has been arrested by the National Investigation Agency from a town suburb in the early hours of Saturday. By the time the town woke up on Saturday morning, Iyakub Biswas and Mosaraf Hossen had been nabbed and taken away to the NIA’s safe house in Kochi. Even the Kerala Police came to know about the arrests only after the Al Qaeda activists were safely put into the NIA custody. It has been widely known that Perumbavoor has become a safe haven for Maoists on the run as well as Islamic extremist elements. Former chief of Kerala Police T P Senkumar and former director general of police Jacob Thomas had warned the Kerala Government many times about the influx of terrorists to Kerala, especially to Perumbavoor. “The town is home to more than 800 plywood companies and hundreds of quarries.  Most of these units depend on migrant workers because it is difficult to get local residents for the low salaries offered by the entrepreneurs. The migrant workers, mostly from Bengal and Assam are willing to work for as little as Rs 800 per day,” said S Sasidharan, entrepreneur who owns timber mills and plywood packaging units. The town shot into national attention in 2016 when a local teenager Jisha was found murdered. “The Police arrested a migrant worker allegedly from Bengal. There were more such murders and the accused were migrant workers,” said Sasidharan. Both Senkumar and Thomas had alerted the Government about the dangers posed by the unprecedented arrival of migrant laborers. “It is difficult to distinguish the Bengali workers from that of Bangladeshi workers because they have the same physique and slang,” said T G Mohandas, columnist. There are no official records about the workers who come to Kerala in search of livelihood. But political intervention led to the shooting down of all moves to introduce an identification system to  tag the migrant workers in the town.    ",india
Tunnel found in Al-Qaeda mole’s house,"  One of the Al Qaeda terror moles Abu Sufiyan arrested from Murshidabad had constructed a secret tunnel inside his house at Raninagar, National Investigation Agency sources that busted the network said adding the tunnel apparently made to store explosives was about 7-8 feet deep. Sufiyan’s kin however contradicted the claim saying it was not a tunnel but a newly constructed sanitary tank still not in use. “They came and arrested my husband without any proof… you can ask the locals who would vouch for his honesty and straightforwardness. He never killed a crow . Insofar as the tunnel is concerned it is a new sanitary tank which was covered with a tin and would be put to use soon,” Nrunnisa Biwi the wife of Sufiyan said. A neighbour Manjur Sheikh too said that he had “personally gone into the tunnel after the news became public but it did not look like a tunnel. It is more of a tank chamber than anything else.” Sufiyan is one of the six Qaeda terror moles arrested on Saturday from Murshidabad bordering Bangaldesh. His other three cronies including mastermind Murshid was pocked up from Ernakulam district of Kerala from where he operated the network under the instructions of one Hamza currently being looked for the NIA. Murshid too is from Murshidabad and was directed by his ‘handlers’ to recruit people for some bigger plans. NIA sources also informed having recovered two Kashmir sim cards from the persons of Najmul Sakib and Atiur two other moles who were second year science students. Huge monetary transactions were made from their accounts sources said. A Kolkata court granted a transit remand for the accused who would be produced at the Patiala House Court in Delhi before September 25, said Shyamal Ghosh NIA advocate. Meanwhile, Bengal Governor Jagdeep Shankar once again attacked the Trinamool Congress Government for reducing the State into a “home to illegal bomb-making.” Attacking the State Government for the worsening law and order situation he said “State has become home to illegal bomb making that has the potential to unsettle democracy,” adding police were “busy in carrying out political errands and taking on the opposition. Those at helm of the WB Police cannot escape their accountability for this alarming decline in law and order”Alleging that the Director General of Police was taking an “ostrich stance” which was “very disturbing,” he said “How far distanced is DGP from reality is cause of worry. His ‘Ostrich Stance’ is very disturbing. … Problem is with those at the helm who are unmindful of conduct and are politically guided.” Elsewhere, in what the ruling Trinamool Congress leadership smelt a “politics of victimisation” the NIA had issued summons to the TMC jangal mahal leader Chhatradhar Mahato who was arrested by the Left Government under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for his alleged links with the Maoists and was released from jail very recently after spending more than a decade in incarceration. “It seems that the BJP is nervous about Mahato’s joining the TMC and his influence in Jangal Mahal where the party claims to have made some inroads. So they are using NIA,” a Trinamool leader said.  ",india

China agrees for talk to defuse border tension’,"  After dilly dallying for days, China has agreed to have another round of high level military level talks with India on Monday to resolve the ongoing tension at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.  This meeting was agreed upon in the parleys between External Affairs Minister  S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on September 10 in Moscow. The two ministers agreed for speedy disengagement and de-escalation at the border. The military talks comprise Corps Commander level talks between Lt General Harinder Singh and his Chinese counterpart Major General Liu Lin.  They have already held five rounds of talks since June 6 to bring down temperatures but these parleys did not yield any result. The last round was held on August 2 and both the sides agreed to withdraw mutually from all the friction points and reduce additional troops and weapons from the depth areas on either sides of the LAC. However, China did not honour the commitment and refused to withdraw troops leading to increasing tension in the already volatile situation.  In fact, this issue figured prominently during Defence Minister Rajnath Singh talks with China defence minister Wei Fenghe and the foreign ministers of the two nations. At the moment, more than one lakh troops from both the countries are amassed at the 1,700 km LAC in the Ladakh.  The China Study Group headed by National Security Advisor (NSA)Ajit Doval two days back finalized the stand to be taken by the Indian commander during the forthcoming talks The high powered CSG attended by the Defence Minister and the external affairs minister besides the military top brass also reviewed the operational readiness of the armed forces in guarding the 4,000 km long LAC stretching  from Ladakh in the west to Arunachal Pradesh in the east.

Pak has been eliminating its Sikh population for decades: Author,"  Pakistan has been eliminating its Sikh population for decades through killings,  abductions and forced marriages of young women, yet is funding and fueling Khalistani terrorism and separatist movement globally to achieve it sinister plans to break up India, a Canadian expert, who authored a recently released report on the subject, has said. Terry Milewski, who wrote the September  9 report “Khalistan: A Project of Pakistan” published by the Canadian think-tank MacDonald-Laurier Institute, said the Khalistani terrorist had sworn their allegiance to Pakistan, which in turn has pledged to play the tunes of China. He made these observations at a webinar “Khalistani Terrorism and Canada” organised by Delhi-headquartered think-tank Law and Society Alliance and strategic affairs publication Defence.Capital through video conferencing over the weekend. The MacDonald-Laurier Institute report has triggered an intense global debate on Khalistani terrorism, and exposing Pakistan’s major hand in it. Milewski said his report had exposed the Khalistan extremists and Pakistan, where real Sikhs still suffer from forcible conversion to Islam, attack on Gurudwara, abductions and killings. He said the trigger for writing the report even after 35 years of the Khalistani terrorists’ Air India bombing, the largest mass killing Canada has ever seen and its victims yet to see complete justice delivered, was the ambitious Khalistan map that he saw of the ‘Referendum 2020’ campaign. The proposed Khalistan map had included several parts of India, including some landmass of Rajasthan, the entire Indian side of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi. “But this map, put up by Sikhs For Justice as part of the voter enlisting exercise in Canada, did not claim a single inch of Pakistani territory as part of Khalistan. It should have included Lahore, from where Maharaja Ranjit Singh ran an empire, and Nakanana Sahib, where Guru Nanak Dev Ji was born. Why are those parts of land with Sikh history being left out? The answer is that people who are organising the movement for Khalistan cannot afford to run the campaign without Pakistan’s monetary and other kinds of support. They do not want to annoy their masters.” Milewski said he had seen the open Pakistan support to the extremist Khalistani during the August 15 protests organised in front of Indian missions in Canada.

Home Ministry stresses on border management,"  The Union Home Ministry has stressed that border management along frontiers with Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar should be emphasized as seriously as those along the borders with China and Pakistan. Border guarding forces like Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and Assam Rifles have been asked to hold meetings with Union Home Secretary Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Bharat Electronic Limited (BEL) to identify technological solutions for improved border management. The decision was taken by Union Home Ministry Amit Shah on April 2 to review the progress of the recommendations made during his meeting with the border guarding forces late last year, officials said.  The move assumes significance as the frontiers along Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar are considered friendly. Strengthening border management on the alignment with these countries could be seen in the backdrop of either China’s footprint in these countries or Beijing’s likely intent to provoke them in order to reduce Indian influence in the region. In the backdrop of Doklam faceoff and Chinese designs, Shah was alerted and in a farsighted move sought prompt strengthening of border guarding mechanism, officials added.  ",india
MNCs responsbile for 20% carbon dioxide emission,"  Amid ongoing blame-game between the developed and developing nations on who should pay for increasing carbon footprints, a study has pointed out that a fifth of carbon dioxide emissions come from multinational companies’ global supply chains which in effect outsourced to poorer parts of the world. The study, which is published in Nature Climate Change, mapped the emissions generated by multinationals’ assets and suppliers abroad and found that the flow of investment is typically from developed countries to developing ones . “Hence emissions be assigned to countries where the investment comes from, rather than countries where the emissions are generated,” said the study. Mapping the global flow of investment, researchers from UCL and Tianjin University found steady increases in investment from developed to developing countries. For instance, between 2011 and 2016 emissions generated through investment from the US to India increased by nearly half (from 48.3 million tons to 70.7 million tons), while in the same years emissions generated through investment from China to south-east Asia increased tenfold (from 0.7 million tons to 8.2 million tons). In contrast, the study found that carbon emissions from multinationals’ foreign investment fell from a peak of 22 per cent of all emissions in 2011 to 18.7 per cent in 2016. Researchers said this was a result of a trend of “de-globalisation”, with the volume of foreign direct investment shrinking, as well as new technologies and processes making industries more carbon efficient. The findings by UCL and Tianjin University holds immense importance amid the ongoing blamegame between the developed and developing nations on the increasing climate change threat owing to the green house gas emission. The research shows the impact that multinationals can have by encouraging greater energy efficiency among suppliers or by choosing suppliers that are more carbon efficient. Professor Dabo Guan (UCL Bartlett School of Construction & Project Management) said: “Multinational companies have enormous influence stretching far beyond national borders. If the world’s leading companies exercised leadership on climate change - for instance, by requiring energy efficiency in their supply chains - they could have a transformative effect on global efforts to reduce emissions. “However, companies’ climate change policies often have little effect when it comes to big investment decisions such as where to build supply chains. “Assigning emissions to the investor country means multinationals are more accountable for the emissions they generate as a result of these decisions.” Lead author Dr Zengkai Zhang, of Tianjin University, said: “Multinationals are increasingly transferring investment from developed to developing countries. This has the effect of reducing developed countries’ emissions while placing a greater emissions burden on poorer countries. At the same time it is likely to create higher emissions overall, as investment is moved to more ‘carbon intense’ regions.”  ",india
Oxford Covid-19 vaccine: Serum Institute to start final phase of trial from Monday,"  Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is likely to start  from Monday the final stage of the clinical trial of University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc.’s experimental vaccine. The late-stage trial will take place at the Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. In the third phase of the clinical trial, around 150-200 volunteers will administer a dose of Covishield. “Some volunteers have already come forward for the trial,” a senior official from the company said. The Sassoon General Hospital in Pune has started enrolling volunteers from Saturday. “Those who are willing to volunteer for the vaccination should contact the hospital,” he said. The phase II trial of Covishield was conducted at Bharti Vidyapeeth Medical College and King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Pune. SII has inked a pact with British-Swedish company AstraZeneca to manufacture COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed by the University of Oxford. The vaccine maker earlier shortlisted 17 sites in India for the Phase II clinical trial of Covid-19 vaccine. At least 1,600 candidates aged between 18 to 55, participated in the Phase II clinical trial. On September 10, the drug maker had paused the clinical trials of the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine candidate in India in the wake of AstraZeneca suspending the clinical trials in other countries. On September 15 the DCGI granted permission to SII to resume trial, while revoking its earlier order of suspending any new recruitment for phase II and III trial.  ",india
"Manage oxygen availability effectively, States told","  Following reports of shortage of oxygen in some States threatening the management of patients suffering from Covid-19, the Centre has asked the States to focus on analysing district level and health facility level status and effectively plan and manage logistical issues related with oxygen availability. The suggestion came in the wake of an increasing number of cases across the country which is likely to push up the demand for oxygen as well. At a high-level meeting held here under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary, Rajiv Gauba , special instructions were issued for oxygen availability to the 12 States/UT including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Chandigarh, Telangana, Kerala, Delhi, Punjab and West Bengal where about 80 per cent of the Covid caseload in the country is concentrated. The Cabinet Secretary while complementing the States for significantly ramping up testing, expressed concern that the case fatality rates of several States are still higher than that of the national average. He urged the States to analyse mortalities district and hospital wise for identification of critical areas of intervention. A day ago, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla had asked all the States to ensure free movement of vehicles carrying oxygen “as it is an essential public health commodity and an important prerequisite for managing moderate and severe Covid-19 cases.”    ",india
ECI to set up national database to track status of ex-gratia payments,"  Taking note of the delay in giving compensation, the Election commission (EC) is planning to set up a database to track the status of ex-gratia payments to those who got injured or lost their lives while polling or poll-related duty. In a letter to chief electoral officers of all states and union territories, the EC has asked to track all such claims. At present, the poll watchdog pays Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of those who died in poll duties through cheques. “A stern view has been taken of the institutional failure and lack of sensitivity, bordering on apathy, on part of the administrative machinery, which failed to respect the memory of the departed,” EC said in the letter. The letter asked CEOs to create a digital database to track the settlement of such legacy claims and all future claims. A national level database will also be created by the commission. EC is also working out the modalities of how payments will be expedited to reduce any kind of inconvenience to the families. Last month, Pramila Devi, the wife of late Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan Ramesh Kumar, 31, wrote to chief election commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora, highlighting the delay in such payments. Kumar died in a grenade attack during the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir elections. In her letter dated August 10, Devi said she had not received the payment; she was entitled to Rs 5 lakh as per the allotment 18 years ago. Following her letter, the Commission acted immediately to get the sum remitted to her without any further delay and later also transferred Rs 15 lakhs to her account.  ",india
"Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal to remove 160 fake Khadi products from platforms","  E-commerce portals like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal and others have been forced to  remove over 160 web links selling products in the brand name of “Khadi” after the Khadi and Village Industries Commission’s (KVIC) served  legal notices on over 1000 firms for misusing its brand name  to sell their products. After KVIC served legal notice, Khadi Global has also discontinued using its website www.khadiglobalstore.com and also removed its social media pages on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. It has  sought 10-day time to remove all such contents and product using the brand name “Khadi”. KVIC action has also resulted in shutting down of a number of stores across the country that were selling fake Khadi products. These e-commerce portals were selling products like Khadi masks, herbals soaps, shampoos, cosmetics, herbal mehandi, jackets, kurta and many such products through different sellers using the brand name “Khadi”. This created a false impression among online buyers that these commodities were genuine “Khadi” products. A majority of the products that have been removed were being sold by one Ayush E-Traders. This firm has confirmed to KVIC that it has removed 140 links for various products that were being sold as “Vagad’s Khadi Products”. There has been a steep rise in violation of Khadi trademark as the popularity of Khadi grew manifold in recent years after the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s appeal to buy Khadi products. Exploiting this opportunity, a number of online sellers began selling random products in the name of Khadi. Also hundreds of stores mushroomed in different cities that were selling fake Khadi products. In recent months, particularly during the Covid-19 lockdown, there was a huge proliferation of such fraudulent online sellers. However, to enable online customers to buy genuine Khadi products, KVIC has launched its e-portal selling a range of 300 products online at www.kviconline.gov.in/khadimask. KVIC Chairman Shri Vinai Kumar Saxena said the KVIC has given violators the option of either stop selling products in the name of Khadi or legal action will be initiated for recovery of heavy damages. “Legal notices have been issued to various firms essentially to safeguard the interest of Khadi artisans. This trademark violation has a direct bearing on the livelihood of our artisans who are making genuine handcrafted products,” Saxena said.  ",india

NEP tailored to meet 21st century edu needs: Kovind,"  President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said the new National Education Policy (NEP) aims to reorient the education system towards meeting the needs of the 21st century by achieving the twin objectives of inclusion and excellence and will also restore India’s glory as a learning centre. Speaking at the inaugural address of Visitors’ Conference on ‘Implementation of NEP in Higher Education’, Kovind said the policy sets the vision of developing an equitable and vibrant knowledge society by providing quality education to all. Vice Chancellors of all Central Universities and Directors of IITs, NITs, SPAs etc were present on the occasion besides the Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and top Ministry officials. He drew inspiration from Bhagvad Gita and the Krishna-Arjun dialogue while reiterating the concept of free communication and discussion between the teacher and the student. “Effective implementation of the NEP 2020 is likely to restore India’s glory as a great centre of learning as during the times of Takshashila and Nalanda,” Kovind added. The President said according to the All India Survey of Higher Education for 2018-19, GER for females is slightly higher than that for males. However, the share of female students is extremely low in Institutions of National Importance and particularly low in technical education. Emphasising that NEP has focus on equity and inclusion, he said that such gender disparity in higher education should be corrected. Union Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said the NEP has given access to foreign universities to open campuses in India and vice-versa which will be instrumental in the process of making India a soft power, the Minister added.

Aligarh lock industry hit hard by new trends,"  There was a time then the whole world was crazy about the cycle and all the cycles around the world were fitted with Aligarh lock at that time. The frame lock was not made anywhere in the world except Aligarh. Its technology and design were prepared by technicians of the Aligarh lock industry. That lock was manufactured in more than hundreds of factories here.  But now the time has changed and this industry has been reduced to 30% only. In addition to the decreased demand for bicycles, the increasing demand for the cable lock and wire lock also results in the lagging demand of frame locks. All kinds of locks are made in Aligarh from the vault to furniture and are export to different countries from here, but by the year 1980, Aligarh was recognized worldwide for its bicycle lock. Konark Lock, Link Lock, Harrison Lock, Master Bajaj Lock, and other well-known brands had established unitary rule on domestic and foreign markets. At that time, 70 to 100 skilled laborers worked in a factory. With passing time, the design of the bicycle changed and the demand also started decreasing because of the bike market. Ranger Cycle replaced Standard Cycle. The locks installed in them started being made in other countries as well with new technologies. Cable and wire lock started trending in the market. Due to the fashion look, the demand of Aligarh's frame lock started decreasing. After 2005, Chinese made cheap wire and cable locks came in the market, this directly affected the manufacturing unit of Aligarh. President of Aligarh Manufacturing Bicycle Lock Association Hari Om Aggarwal said that Aligarh bicycle locks had a worldwide identity but changing trends brought the crisis on this business. Also, due to the shortage of skilled laborers, the manufacturers of the bicycle lock became henchmen. Cable and wire locks are assembled by labors at home. The bicycle used to be a means of transport before, now it has become just a hobby. Now this lock is being made in only 20-25 factories. Director of Link Locks Mohammad Ali said that the market also changes from time to time. Once upon a time, the bicycle was the only means of transport for farmers. Now the Ranger cycle has come in place of standard bicycles which decreases the demand for frame lock in the market. Cable and wire locks are also stepped in the market causes a huge fall in the market of frame locks.

States bank on herbal immunity boosters to defeat corona,"  As the Covid-19 battered world continue to scout for vaccine to combat the deadly virus, States in India are banking on herbal immunity boosters among other safety norms like masks and social distancing  to keep the pathogen at a bay which has so far infected 54 lakhs people and claimed 83,000 lives across the country. While Tamil Nadu is distributing Siddha-based herbal immunity boosters like ‘Athimathuram’ and ‘Kabasura Kudineer’, Karnataka is supplying ayurveda-based immunity enhancing tablets and decoction to the locals as part of the fight against coronavirus. So is the case with Delhi and Punjab where cops are being armed with the formulation based on medicinal plants and essential oils to fight the virus from the front. Punjab has recently announced doling out to its police personnel Covid-care kits having medical gadgets like mask, oximeter besides medicines and an herbal immunity booster Amynity Plus to combat the virus. Nearly 3,800 police personnel have tested Covid positive in the State. The herbal formulation is extract of around 51 herbs like harad, Neem, Amla, Sunthi, Ashwagandha, Gudduchi besides eight essential oils to empower immunity of the body system. Dr Sanchit Sharma, Executive Director of AIMIL Pharmaceuticals which has developed the herbal brew, noted that not only a strong immune system but multi-system immune defence could be the perfect solution to tackle the infection which has brought the world standstill. Like in Punjab, police personnel in Delhi are being distributed ‘Ayuraksha Kit’ comprising of ‘Kadha’ concoction (herbal tea), ‘Sanshmani’ tablet (made from Giloy), oil to be used as nasal drops and pack of Chyawanprash while Tamil Nadu is offering the concoction like ‘Athimathuram’ and ‘Kabasura Kudineer’. “These are not a cure for Covid-19 but for boosting the immunity of an individual,” said Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami launched the scheme by distributing the drink to police personnel. Similarly, Karnataka Government is offering ayurveda-based immunity boosting tablets and decoction to lakhs of families in Shivamogga under an initiative by Karnataka Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K S Eshwarappa as part of the fight against covid-19. Likewise, Uttar Pradesh too is pushing herbal immunity boosters to fight the virus. In fact, scientists from Government organisations too are doing their bit in this regard. For instance, Dr Sanjay Jachak, scientist from Researchers from National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) in Mohali, Punjab has developed an immunity booster herbal tea —a combination of six herbs such as Aswagandha, Giloy, Mulethi, Tulsi and GreenTea--to strengthen the body and build physical resistance to the virulent infections.

"Indian genes helpful in battling coronavirus, reducing mortality rate: Study","  Indian genes are helping battling coronavirus and reducing the mortality rate in comparison to the US and Europe, according to scientists including an expert from the Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The study is published in the PLOS ONE journal. A team comprising distinguished genetic experts from six institutions, led by Prof Gyaneshwer Chaubey of the BHU, analysed complete DNA data of the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene of X chromosome from various continental populations and found that it is the Indian genes that have protected the population and helped battle the deadly virus. This explains why the mortality rate of COVID-19 has been much higher in European countries and in the US, as compared to India and Southeast Asian countries, they said. The scientists have provided a possible molecular genetic explanation for why Iranians, Europeans and Americans of European ancestry are at more mortality risk to the novel Coronavirus than people in India and East Asia, as reflected in the current global distribution of reported COVID-19 cases per 1,00,000 inhabitants. The international team analysed complete DNA data of the ACE2 gene from various continental populations and found that certain mutations in this gene are helping South Asian and East Asian populations in successfully battling the virus and reducing mortality rate in comparison to the US and Europe. There have been a few initial studies on the ACE2 gene by other research groups, but all of them looked for the presence or absence of various mutations, whereas, this team used more powerful haplotype-based analysis (the method in which experts break the whole length of DNA into several pieces and make comparisons). The second important finding is about two major mutations which are responsible for strengthening the entry point of the Coronavirus among South Asians. “Thus, this paper adds important potential implications to understanding the transmission patterns of Coronavirus in various populations across the world,” said Anshika Srivastava, one of the authors of the paper. Rudra Pandey and Prajwal Singh from BHU, Avinash Rasalkar, Pankaj Srivastava from Sagar Central University, Rakesh Tamang from Calcutta University and Pramod Kumar from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) were also involved in this research.

"BJP, Congress conspiring to sabotage Govt: CPM","  The CPI(M) on Friday alleged that there was a deep-rooted conspiracy by the BJP and the Congress against the Government of Kerala and the current unrest seen in the State is a proof of this secret plan. “The BJP and the Congress want to sabotage and derail the Kerala Government led by the CPI(M). A conspiracy has been hatched by the Sangh Parivar and the Congress to murder Minister K T Jaleel. The attacks on the official car of the Minister on Thursday by the BJP elements is proof of this plan,” said Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, CPI(M) Kerala secretary during a press meet at the capital city on Friday. Balakrishnan was addressing the media after Friday’s State Secretariat meet of the CPI(M). He said there was nothing unusual in the National Investigation Agency summoning Jaleel to their office. “The NIA in its letter of invitation sent to Jaleel has said that the agency would like to speak to him as a witness. But the Congress and the BJP are blowing it out of proportion,” said the Secretary who se son Bineesh Kodiyeri too had been invited by the Enforcement Directorate recently. Balakrishnan said that the BJP and the Congress were on a massive drive to recruit goondas to eliminate the CPI(M) cadre and the State Government has all the documentary evidence. “The Congress is organizing ‘get togethers’ of its goonda elements across Kerala. The BJP is also doing the same thing,” he said. The State Secretariat in its meeting concluded that the Centre was deliberately denying and delaying the financial dues meant for the State. “ The Congress is upset over the general impression that the CPI(M) would come back to power in the 2021 Assembly election and that party is staring at a bleak future. Irrespective of the attitudes of the BJP and the Congress, the CPI(M) is going ahead with its development agenda for the welfare of the people,” said Balakrishnan while explaining the decisions taken in the Secretariat meeting. He also said that the Muslim League and the BJP were coming together. “The CPI(M) has become the common enemy of these parties and we are launching a campaign drive across Kerala to convince the people about this unholy alliance. The BJP is implementing its communal agenda through protests and demonstrations,” he  said.     ",india
RS passes Bill to cut MPs’ salaries by 30% for yr,"  Parliament on Friday passed a Bill to reduce for one year the salaries of MPs by 30 per cent “to meet the exigencies arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic”. The Bill was passed in Rajya Sabha with a voice vote while Lok Sabha had passed the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020 Bill earlier this week. The Rajya Sabha also approved two Bills, replacing ordinances related to the Central Council of Homoeopathy and the Indian Medicine Central Council. While supporting the cuts in salaries, most Opposition members who participated in the discussion urged the government to review its decision to suspend the Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) scheme for two years saying it was necessary to carry out development works in their respective constituencies.  Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, however, said this was a temporary suspension. Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy moved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and both bills were taken up simultaneously and passed by voice vote. During the debate, Joshi said it did not matter how much money was being saved through salary cuts of members. “Charity should begin from home and that is the concept we have started. It is not Rs 4 crore saving as said by DMK member but Rs  53.9 crore per year from members’ salary,” he said. DMK member P Wilson had earlier during the discussion said the measure would entail savings of just Rs 4 crore. On several opposition members asking the government to stop various projects like Bullet train and construction of a new Parliament building to cut costs, Joshi said, “First you say public spending should be increased and now you are demanding that all these projects should be stopped. At least, we don’t pay to some private trust from PM Relief fund. These people raised similar issues in 2019 election and people have answered,” Joshi further said. Reddy said COVID-19 has impacted the incomes of people working in the private sector and so the Prime Minister initiated this bill which entails 30 per cent reduction in ministers’ salaries. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said around 70 per cent MPs depend on their salaries and have to take care of every expense through these emoluments alone. He said MPLAD funds are meant for taking care of needy people in their constituencies and are utilised for various things like purchasing ambulances, making small roads and community centres. “It (MPLAD) should not be suspended for two years. How did you presume that corona will go on for two years? Even if you had to do it you should have reduced it by half to Rs 2.5 crore. My suggestion to the Government will be to reduce it to one year and in that one year Rs 2.5 crore fund be kept,” he said. Similarly, Vishambhar Prasad Nishad (SP), V Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP), K Somaprasad (CPI-M), Fauzia Khan (NCP), Veer Singh (BSP), Nazir Ahmed Laway (PDP) while supporting the reduction in salaries, sought restoration of the MPLAD scheme. Pointing at the PM CARES fund, Congress MP Rajeev Satav said “no one knows to whom it is caring”. He also pointed out expenses by the government during the pandemic on projects such as Central Vista, Bullet train and a special Rs 850 crore aircraft for the PM. Trinamool Congress member Dinesh Trivedi said the bill for reduction of members’ salaries was decided only by some MPs on whatsapp.  ",india

Babasaheb memorial: Uddhav to lay foundation stone of 350 ft tall Ambedkar statue today,"  Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will lay the foundation stone for the 350 ft statue of late Babasaheb Ambedkar raised as part of the grand memorial for the late architect of Indian Constitution being developed at the Indu Mills compound at Dadar in north-central Mumbai, on Friday. Five years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid foundation stone of late Ambedkar’s grand memorial, Uddhav will kick-start the work on building of a statue of the iconic Dalit leader. Friday’s will be the biggest state government programme to be held during the lockdown period. Apart from Uddhav and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, many of the ministers in his Cabinet will attend the programme which will be as per various social distancing norms.      The work on the construction of the Ambedkar had been hanging fire for the first four years. To be developed by the state-run Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the memorial will cost Rs 1,089 crore as per the revised estimates. On its part, the MMRDA has already started the construction. Excavation and piling work has been completed, while the work on the auditorium basement comprising two-floors below its framework has been completed. The height of Dr Ambedkar’s statue, which was earlier proposed to be of the height of 250 feet, will now be 350 feet.  The statue will be erected on a pedestal of the height of 100 feet. In essence, the collective height of the bronze statue will be 450 feet. There will be elements of the Buddhist architecture in the Ambedkar memorial, which is coming up on a 12 acre plot of land. While 68 per cent of the land will be open lawn, there will be a training centre that can accommodate 400 people, a state-art auditorium and a museum-cum-exhibition hall at the memorial. Trees will be planted on ‘parikrama’ as a median to segregate the inward and outward visitor movement. It will also provide shade to the visitors. In addition, the viewing gallery width will have a dedicated upward and downward movement by providing railing in between. Also, customised LED lights will be installed. It may be recalled that October 11, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the grand memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar at the Indu Mills compound. Six days earlier – i.e., on April 5, 2015, the 12 acre plot of land -- owned by the state-run National Textile Corporation (NTC) – had been transferred to the Maharashtra government, through a tripartite agreement signed among Union textile minister, government of Maharashtra and National Textile Corporation in Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Later on March 25, 2017, the Centre handed over the documents transferring 12 acres of land located in the defunct Indu Mill compound to the Maharashtra government, thus paving way for the start of construction of the memorial.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a public servant dedicated to public sentiment","  Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare It is the responsibility of any Government to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of the people and bring positive changes in the lives of the poor.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been efficiently discharging this responsibility through his hard work for the last six years.  On September 17, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to complete 70 years of his life.  This is the best time to observe his great personality and the many works of public welfare that are taking place under his leadership. Since independence, governments have formulated their own policy from time to time on basic amenities like health and education in India. Ever since I came into politics, I used to hear the same slogan, ‘Poverty be removed’, but without knowing the origin of this poverty, the governments decided the policy due to which they did not appear successful in removing poverty.  There was a time when people at the top of power said that money is sent from Delhi, but it does not reach the people completely.  Today you see how when the leadership is in skilled and capable hands, then the picture of the country and the fate of the common people changes.  Our inspirational Pandit Dayanalji gave us the mantra of Antyodaya, today this mantra has become the mantra of our government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi created the policy knowing the basic problems of poverty so that the gap between this government and the poor can be ended.  Gone.  There are many such schemes which have proved effective in raising the standard of living of the poor.  Whether it is about Jan Dhan Yojana or Mudra Yojana, Ayushman Yojana or Ujjwala or Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, public welfare was given paramount in all schemes.  More than that, we have been successful in getting the benefit of the schemes to the beneficiary in a shorter time than the target.  This change has come under the guidance of the Prime Minister of India, we know this in the name of good governance.  In this era of epidemic, we have benefited every poor person in the country through various schemes. Today, when the whole world is battling the corona virus disease, under the leadership of our Prime Minister, India is not only fighting this deadly virus but is also working to give a message to the world.  That message is about humanity, the sense of responsibility of the government. This virus posed a new challenge for the whole world.  Immediately after the virus started spreading in China, on 8 January, under the leadership and guidance of the Prime Minister, the government started taking a meeting with experts with utmost seriousness. On 30 January, before the first case of Corona was found in India, India started thermal screening of all the passengers coming from China.  We also had 6 labs and 6 quarantine centers.  Certainly, under the leadership of our famous Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the health structure of the country was getting ready to fight against this invisible enemy.  In February, the government also started screening people from other countries such as Vietnam, Nepal, Indonesia.  Our government also issued advisory for travelers going to Italy, South Korea.  We started universal thermal screening in early March.  The Prime Minister advised citizens across the country not to gather crowds on Holi and distanced themselves from all the events. The public curfew was announced only in March when there were less than 200 cases.  After this, on March 24, a 21-day lockdown was announced.  After the nationwide lockdown, our Prime Minister, who was filled with the spirit of public welfare, released a poor welfare economic package of 1 lakh 70 thousand crore.  He gave this message to the world that it is possible to compensate for the loss of money, but it is not possible to compensate for the loss of public.  The Prime Minister said that ‘Jaan hai to jahan hai’.  Gradually, when our health structure was completely ready to beat Corona.  As of 15 September, we have 1690 Kovid dedicated hospitals.  Where the counting experiment was done initially.  Today, the number of government and private laboratories is 1736.  It is increasing daily.  Our recovery rate is increasing daily by 15 September and it has reached 79%.  About 4 million corona infections have been cured.  Testing capacity has exceeded 1 million tests per day.  On 15 September, 11 lakh 16 thousand 882 tests were held.  Our death rate is much lower than other countries.  This was the question in everyone’s mind that how the economic loss will be reduced, and how the financial speed will get to the country, then the Prime Minister announced the self-sufficient India campaign.  Under this, a package of twenty lakh crore rupees was earmarked for all sectors.  It would be called the foresight of the leadership that we took care of everyone from migrant workers to street vendors and farmers.  People are also getting the benefit of this scheme at a fast pace.  Under Nabard, under the Self-Reliant India Package, 30 thousand crores for farmers, refunds of more than 1 lakh crores were given to more than 27 lakh taxpayers from 1 April till now.  During this time, record sales of medicines have been recorded in various areas such as Jan Aushadhi centers.  Sales of 191.90 crore by the end of July.  The simple reason for this is that the prices of medicines at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper by 50 to 90 percent. During this time the biggest success was that all the beneficiaries got direct benefits of the scheme without any middlemen.  His money came directly into his account.  For example, farmers have been sent money through DBT to farmers, including Kisan Samman Nidhi, women Jan Dhan account holders, our construction workers and other beneficiaries. In the account of about 42.08 crore beneficiaries, the Modi government has 68.820 with complete transparency.  Has sent crore  Prime Minister Modi has fought this battle in a phased manner.  With no goal to sleep, the Prime Minister announced the scheme of the Garib Kalyan Yojana, the self-sufficient Bharat Abhiyan was announced to speed up the economic situation, more than 63 lakh migrant laborers were brought to their homes safely by labor special trains.  The food scheme was expanded so that they got free food.  Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana was announced for his employment.  Apart from this, establishing mutual coordination with all the states, communicating from time to time, encouraging health workers, sanitation workers and police personnel, while being devoted to the spirit of public welfare, the Prime Minister considered Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam as the base of the world.  India helped those countries which sought help at the time of this crisis.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also praised by the WHO, including many heads of state, for creating and implementing an effective strategy in the fight against Corona.  When the country moved towards unlocking, Modi ji said that both life and world too.  The Prime Minister’s addresses renewed consciousness among the citizens of the country. On every front, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was completely successful in winning the trust of every citizen of the country.  Coming to the country all the time, he worked to increase enthusiasm and confidence in the people.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proved his acceptance not only in the country but also abroad and has increased the pride of India.  Seoul’s Peace Prize, countries like Bahrain, America, Champions of the Earth (United Nations), Maldives Russia and the UAE also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with the award. The way Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is living his public life, full of discipline, he is well-deserved.  Their hard work inspires us.  On his birthday, I pray to God that he should continue to take the country on the path of development with a sense of public welfare.  ",india

The Congress celebrated the day as ‘National Unemployment Day’ to highlight the jobs lost since the COVID-19 struck the country earlier this year. Youth Congress workers in Bhopal demonstrated by frying fritters and holding banners such as ‘I am a young unemployed’. In the national capital, party workers waved huge banners with Modi’s image and mentioning ‘Berojgar Divas’. “Massive unemployment has forced the youth to call today #NationalUnemploymentDay. Employment is dignity. For how long will the Govt deny it?,” Rahul, who is currently out of the country for treatment of his mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, tweeted. Priyanka said the youth of the country wants that the Government must hold exams for Government jobs on time and the results should be declared in a fix time frame. She added that the Government must create more job opprtunities and if the Centre will fail to address the concerns of the youth then they will change the Government.

Bangladesh seeks lifting of ban on onion export by Modi Govt,"  Worried over skyrocketing onion prices in the retail market, Bangladesh has requested the Modi Government to withdraw the ban imposed on its export as soon as possible. The Government had on Monday banned the export of all varieties of onions with immediate effect to increase availability and curb prices of the commodity in the domestic market. Onion prices in Bangladesh have touched 200 taka per kg while it is being sold at Rs 40-45 per kg across India. Onion traders and political parties including Congress and NCP are demanding reversal of the ban order while retailers expect a Rs 2-5 per kg drop in the rate due to the export ban. Expressing deep concern over the sudden ban on the export of onions as it directly affects the supply of essential food items in market, the Bangladesh government in a letter dated September 15, requested the Indian High Commission to convey the message to authorities in New Delhi and take necessary measures to resume onion exports taking into consideration the excellent ties between the neighbours. It pointed out that a secretary-level meeting between the commerce ministries of the two countries held on January 15-16, 2020 in Dhaka requested India not to impose export restriction on essential food items required by Bangladesh. The letter said the Bangladesh side also requested India to inform Dhaka ahead of time in case of any event necessitating such a restriction. During April-June period, onion exports to Bangladesh, India’s largest overseas market for the key kitchen ingredient, shot up 147.5% to 1.9 lakh metric tonne. Overall, onion exports grew 23% during the same period to 6.8 lakh metric tonne. During her visit to India in October last year after the onion export ban, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina had said, “We are facing some issues because of the ban on onion exports from India. I don’t know why you banned export of onions. It would have been better if you had alerted us in advance so that we could have sourced onions from other countries. You banned it suddenly and it became a problem for us).” Hasina had then said in jest that she had asked her cook not to use onions in the kitchen.  ",india

Cong leader slams Kangana for using ‘filthy’ language against Urmila,"  Hitting out at actress Kangana Ranaut for her comments against yester-year actress Urmila Matondkar whom she called “a soft porn star”, Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant on Thursday charged that Kangana had shown her true colours by using unbearably filthy language against Urmila, an actress hailing from Maharashtra. “With the support from the BJP, Kangana is constantly insulting Maharashtra but now she has crossed all limits. She has also shown her true colours by using unbearably filthy language about actress Urmila Matondkar,” Sawant said. “Maharashtra is proud of Urmila Matondkar. the BJP, which has repeatedly insulted Maharashtra through Kangana, should immediately apologise to the 13 crore people of the state,” the State Congress general secretary said. “This is not just an insult to Urmila but an insult to all my sisters. Urmila comes from a middle class Marathi family and has always kept the culture of Maharashtra and the flag of Marathi high on the basis of her quality acting. Her insult is an insult of Maharashtra. The BJP is equally responsible for all this. The BJP, which lost power in Maharashtra, is taking revenge now,” Sawant said in  a statement issued here. “Kangana, who calls Mumbai Pak Occupied Kashmir, calls the Mumbai police a mafia and criticises Maharashtra and Marathi identity every day, is supported by the BJP. The BJP calls her Jhansi ki Rani, gives her Y-level security, and arranges her visit to the governor. The country has seen her holding a lotus in her hand while visiting Governor Koshyari,” Sawant said, adding that Kangana had gone on record saying she could anytime get a BJP ticket to contest the elections. Urmila,  it may be recalled, had joined the Congress and contested   the Lok Sabha elections from Mumbai unsuccessfully against  BJP's Raju Shetty in the 2019 polls. She quit the Congress after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Sawant’s comments should be in the context of the war of words witnessed between Urmila and Kangana. On her part, Urmila slammed Kangana for comment likening Mumbai to PoK and said she would ""never tolerate any defamatory remark"" about the city. On Kangana’s comment about rampant drug use by Bollywood personalities, Urmila said that if Ms Ranaut had information about illegal drugs in Bollywood she should look to her state — Himachal Pradesh and would be better served by going to the authorities rather than tweeting about it. ""Which girl from a civilised cultured house would use this kind of language? Like 'kya ukhaad loge', 'kiska baap ka kya hai', speaking about Jaya ji the way she did,"" Urmila said in a television interview. Kangana hit back at Urmila by calling her “a soft porn star”. “She isn’t known for acting for sure and is known for doing soft porn. If she can get a ticket, why won’t I get a ticket?,” Kangana asked. “The way she ( Urmila)  was talking about me, completely teasing through the interview, pulling faces or just making a mockery out of my struggles, attacking me on the facts that I am trying to please BJP for a ticket. One doesn’t have to be a genius to figure that for me it is not very difficult to get a ticket. I don’t have to play with my life or get my property ruined,” Kangana told a television channel.

Maha: Cong stages stir against Centre’s ban on onion export,"  Wearing onion garlands around their necks, the Congress staged protests in Nashik district – which has the country’s largest onion market at Lasalgaon and other parts of Maharashtra, against the Narendra Modi Government’s decision to ban exports of onions. In Nashik district which is the epi-centre of protests against the “anti-farmer” policies of the Modi government, the Congress workers – accompanied by onion growing farmers –raised vociferous slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre. On Tuesday, the onion growers and traders had staged a dharna at the market yard of the APMC market at Lasalgaon in Nashik district. “At a time when the farmers in the state have  started to recover from the Covid-19 induced losses, the Modi government has once again dashed their hopes. At a time when the onion crop was fetching good prices in the market, the Modi government suddenly decided to ban exports, causing huge losses to farmers,” Maharashtra Congress president and State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said.  “There is anger among the farmers against the Modi government’s decision to ban onion exports and the state government stands firmly with the farmers.  The Congress’ agitation will continue till the time the union government withdraws the ban on onion exports,” Thorat said. Slamming the Modi government’s decision to ban onion exports, Thorat said: “Recently, the Centre’s decision to import milk powder deprived the opportunity to thousands of dairy farmers to sell tonnes of milk powder lying with them,  resulting in a drop in milk prices. Just as when onions were fetching a good price in the market, a decision to ban exports was taken which has led to the price of onion crashing by Rs 700-800 per quintal”. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Cabinet on Wednesday expressed serious displeasure over the Centre’s decision to ban onion exports. At the weekly State Cabinet meeting, Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat criticised the Centre for its “anti-farmer” decision of banning the export of onions. Briefing the ministers present,  Principal Secretary Anup Kumar said that during 2018-19 farmers from Maharashtra had exported 21.83 metric tonnes of Onion, while they had exported 18.50 metric tonnes of onion during 2019-20. Senior Minister Eknath Shinde told the Cabinet that currently, 4 lakh metric tonnes were lying at the Jawahar Nehru Port, while more than 500 trucks carrying onions were waiting in a queue near the Nepal border.

Archaeological hotspot ‘Sinauli’ gets ‘national importance’ tag,"  Around 28 hectares of the archaeologically rich site in Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat area in Sinauli where “sacred chambers”, chariots, decorated “legged coffins” as well as fascinating artifact pointing to the presence of a warrior class around 4,000 years ago were excavated two years ago has got the tag of ‘national importance’. The Government issued a notification in this regard recently. The Union Culture Ministry, which supervises the functioning of the country’s premier conservation body, Archeological Survey of India (ASI), had issued a preliminary notification in June to bring the site under its fold. The aim is to protect the site from encroachment, tampering and destruction. Around 28.67 hectares of land mostly belonging to the locals in the region has been brought under protection, according to which while the farmers of the land will be allowed to carry on agricultural practices but they will not be permitted to construct any permanent structure. “Sanauli is an important site from an archeological point of view as artifacts found from the venue are  not only of national importance but of international importance too.  Much remains yet to be explored,” said archeologist SK Manjul who is credited for the unearthing coffins and sacred chambers important artifacts from the site in 2018.  Sanauli is located on the left bank of the River Yamuna, 68 km north-east of Delhi which brought to light the largest necropolis of the late Harappan period datable to around early part of second millennium BCE. Manjul said that the unearthed  chariots, some coffins, shields, swords and helmets  points towards the existence of a “warrior class in the area around 2,000 BCE”. The three chariots found in burial pits indicate the possibility of “royal burials” while other findings confirm the population of a warrior class here, he added. “These findings are important to understand the culture pattern of the Upper Ganga-Yamuna doab. We found copper swords, helmets, shields and chariots,” Manjul said. He claimed that the discovery of chariots put India on a par with ancient civilisations in Mesopotamia and Greece, where chariots were used extensively.  ",india

"June 19 a ‘black day’, Modi lied to nation on Chinese aggression: Cong","  The Congress on Wednesday called June 19 a “black day” in India’s history, alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lied” to the nation on the day about the Chinese transgressions in Ladakh. The party also attacked the Modi Government for taking loans to the tune of $750 million (Rs 5,521 crore) from Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to provide financial support to the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), a scheme launched to help the poor hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, at a time when the armed forces were fighting China’s People’s Liberation Army in eastern Ladakh. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi too attacked the government on the issue. “Understand the chronology: PM said no one has entered Indian territory, then took loans from China-based bank, then defence minister said China has intruded into our territory and now home minister says no infiltration along India-China border. Is the Modi government with Indian armed forces or with China? Why is there so much of fear?” Rahul, who is currently abroad, tweeted. Addressing reporters outside the Parliament House complex here, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera claimed that the Union ministers are speaking in different languages on the India-China border standoff. “June 19 is a black day in the history of India because that was the first time that any Prime Minister lied to the nation. Not only did he give a clean chit to China that day, but also signed a loan agreement with the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to the tune of $750 million (Rs 5,521 crore),” he said. China is the largest shareholder in AIIB. “By then, 20 of our brave soldiers had sacrificed their lives while protecting our sovereignty in violent clashes with Chinese troops,” added Khera.

Nadda accuses Cong of being ‘double faced’ over farmers’ Bills,"  Against the backdrop of three bills related to farmers being voted in Parliament, BJP President JP Nadda on Wednesday charged the Congress with being “double faced” and playing politics by opposing the “revolutionary bills” in the two houses even as he asserted that Prime Minster Narendra Modi is actually implementing  what the opposition party had promised to the farmers in its 2019 manifesto. A day after the Lok Sabha passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment)Bill, 2020, which seeks to deregulate food items, including cereals , pulses and onion and aimed at raising farmers’ income, the BJP claimed that its Government was “freeing” farmers from an outdated  and restrictive system. The Bill, which would now go to the  Rajya Sabha  and two other bills on the  floor, have been described  as “revolutionary” and “far sighted” by Nadda.  He said it would increase the price of the produce, give freedom to farmers to sell their produce outside the ‘Mandi’ and increase private investment in agriculture. He said the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, had turned outdated as it was then needed to regulate the market and prevent hoarding. The produce of wheat, rice and dal, he said, has now increased ten, four and  two and half-times respectively and the market requires to be deregulated. “You can now sell produce outside mandi also in a  competitive market to get the best price in a transparent manner,” said the BJP President. Nadda said contract farming would be on a written document on the produce and not on the land with “ assured price, bonus and variables for the farmer”, he claimed. Charging Congress with having a “double-faced” stand, the BJP chief said Congress promised to remove all restrictions on the  agriculture produce  in its 2019 manifesto and demanded replacement of 1955 Act. “Modiji has implemented what Congress promised. The same Congress is now opposing these bills in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,” Nadda  said and asserted they were meant for the “azadi of kisans”. He said despite the progressive legislation for farmers, the system of Minimum Support Price for the farmers would continue.  ",india

SC says need to regulate electronic media; Centre bats for journalistic freedom,"  There is a need to regulate the electronic media as most of the channels are running for TRPs, leading to “more sensationalism”, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday even as the Centre batted for journalistic freedom saying it would be “disastrous” for any democracy to control the Press. The apex court, making clear it is not suggesting “censorship on media”, said there should be some kind of self-regulation in the media. “Regulating internet is very difficult but we need to regulate the electronic media now,” a bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said. The top court said this while hearing a plea which has raised grievance over Sudarshan TV’s “Bindas Bol” programme whose promo had claimed that the channel would show the ‘big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in Government service’. While the apex court said that some kind of self-regulation in media was needed, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued that “freedom of journalist is supreme”. “It would be disastrous for any democracy to control press,” Mehta told the bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and KM Joseph. Mehta said sometimes certain channels are being used for providing medium to accused to point his or her views. Mehta also said that it needs to be seen if a potential accused could be given a platform to air his or her defense. “The problem with electronic media is all about TRPs, thus leading to more and more sensationalism. So many things masquerade as a form of right,” the bench observed. The apex court said the electronic media has “become more powerful than print media and we have not been supportive of pre-broadcast ban”.  ",india

The exercise was undertaken for a comprehensive assessment of the Covid-19 situation in Delhi and to formulate strategies based on its findings. The samples collected as part of this exercise spanned different areas and age groups, gender and economic class. Antibodies against Covid-19 infection were found in 29.1 per cent of people in the August sero-prevalence survey in the national capital, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said late last month while announcing its results. Prevalence of antibodies found in males was 28.3 per cent, and in females 32.2 per cent. Out of total number of samples, 25 per cent were taken from the age group of less than 18 years, another 50 per cent from 18-49 years age bracket and remaining 25 per cent from those in the age group of 50 years or more, the Delhi Health Minister had said. Among the people sampled, who had Covid-19 earlier and recovered but did not show antibodies during the survey might have had contracted the disease several months ago at the early stage of the novel coronavirus infection. So, their antibodies (IgG) might have disappeared, experts said. But in most cases, the memory cells would remember the virus and trigger an immune response if a person who has recovered from Covid-19 is again attacked by the virus, they said. On longevity of antibodies developed in response to Covid-19, Jain on August 20 had said, according to experts these antibodies can last for several months — say 5-8 months — but the body also produces T-cells in response to the infection. These T-cells, also called memory cells, help fight any possible infection again, and so, it is “very rare” that a person who has recovered from Covid-19 will be diagnosed with it again, the heath minister had said. Scientists and experts at Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) had led the technical team of the August survey. The sero-prevalence found in northeast district was 29.6 per cent, south district 27.2 per cent, southeast 33.2 per cent and New Delhi 24.6 per cent. The report also said the participants who were living in or had ever lived in a containment zone in Delhi, had a “significantly higher sero-prevalance” than those who had never lived in it.  ",india

The then state BJP Government did not give justice to Shri Mahajan. I have received several applications in this matter and have ordered investigation in this matter”. “The offence was committed in 2016 but due to the State BJP Government protection to Shri Patil no FIR was filed.

The family had to approach the High Court to even get a case registered. To date, no action has been taken by the BJP against its own MP,” Sawant tweeted. Thanking the current MVA government for ordering investigation into the delay in acting against BJPMP Unmesh Patil, Sawant tweeted: “Instead of punishing BJP MP & others who attacked our army veteran, Fadnavis govt persecuted him by putting him in jail as well as externing him. Even after HC direction, no action was taken. MVA govt & @anildeshmukhncp have given Sonu Mahajan ji justice #JusticeForSonuMahajan”.  ",india

Once a person is exposed to the infection, the disease may develop anytime between 1 and 14 days. The main symptoms of Covid are fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing,” the Minister told the House. Dr Harsh Vardhan also said expenditure finance memorandum of Rs 65,560.98 crore under the Prime Minister Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana for strengthening the health sector is under consideration. This includes investment in research, healthcare and public health infrastructure, with particular focus on pandemic management.

Phase 2 clinical trial of the first-ever phytopharmaceutical ACQH is under way. One prophylactic trial of Aswagandha and three trials of Guduchi + Pippali; Yashtimadhu; and polyherbal AYUSH drug (AYUSH-64) are planned on moderately ill Covid-19 patients,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said. “Globally, there are around 145 candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation and currently 35 vaccines in clinical trial. In India, a major focus has been on facilitating the development of Covid-19 vaccine. More than 30 vaccine candidates have been supported which are in different stages of development, 3 candidates are in advanced stage of Phase I/II/III trials and more than 4 are in advanced pre-clinical development stage,” he said. The Covid-19 Bio-repositories have collected more than 40,000 samples for use by researchers developing diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. The health minister also spoke about the shift in focus from only Covid to other non-Covid diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, which ended up being partially neglected during the lockdown. “Equally crucial is to maintain the success achieved in management of reproductive maternal and child health, vaccine preventable diseases, non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis, vector borne diseases such as Kala Azar and Malaria. Hence, there is an increased thrust for managing non-Covid essential services,” the minister said.  ",india

UP: Case filed for insulting national flag on handpumps,"  The case of inscriptions and cobblestones fitted with around 45 hand pumps in Dhubia, Khurrampur, and some other villages of Akbarabad police station area has caught fire. A case has been filed on BJP MLA from Chharra Ravendrapal Singh’s complaint against two people in the police station of Akbarabad. According to the MLA, there is a smell of foreign conspiracy, in this case, are coming. MLA Thakur Ravendra Pal Singh reached Akbarabad police station along with some other people. He filed a complaint against Shamsher son of Sher Mohammed, resident of Vijaygarh Khurrampur, and Barik Ali resident of Dhorra. It is alleged that about 45 hand pumps (No.4 small machine) have been installed in various villages including village Dubhia, Khurrampur to mislead the people. An Arabic inscription has been attached to the hand pump along with the Indian flag and the flag of Kuwait.     Only 8 strips in the circle have been shown in the National flag of India instead of 24 under a well thought foreign conspiracy which is a violation of the flag code of India. This is an insult and treason to the National Flag of India. The design of the platform of the hand pump is like the cemetery, a well-planned plot of anti-social elements. Installing a hand pump on 60 feet is a nefarious conspiracy to feed dirty water to the general public so that people fall sick and the image of government will tarnish. Ravendra Pal Singh has investigated the entire case and has sought to expose the conspiracy of foreign forces. He further said that the safety of the people of the area is in danger. These people do not even have any permission from the government for these handpumps. Police have started an investigation on the MLA's complaint by registering a case under the prevention of Insult to National Honor Act, IPC 269.     Handpumps with the UAE flag were installed in Barauli:   During the Lok Sabha election, handpumps with the UAE flag were installed in the Barauli area as well. The complaint had reached the administration but at that time nobody paid any attention. The matter was taken up by All India Hindu Mahasabha at that time. The UAE flag was also made with the inscription on the hand pump. There were no Indian National Flag. Mahasabha national spokesperson Ashok Pandey said that he made a complaint to the then SDM, but no action has been taken. Today when MLA complained, then the administration woke up. MP Satish Gautam said that a case of foreign flags with hand pumps has come into the light. It is also being heard that such works are already going on in the district. He will talk to the local administration and demand an inquiry. The truth should be revealed to all.  ",india
"Names of Sara, Rakul, Simon figured in drug probe: NCB","  The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday confirmed that the names of Bollywood actresses Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet Singh and designer Simone Khambatta had figured in the Sushant Singh Raput death-related drug case, even as a Mumbai court remanded the seven arrested drug peddlers  either in the NCB or in judicial custody for varying periods. Talking to media persons here, NCB’s deputy director (operations) KPS Malhotra said: “There has been an issue that whether the name of Sara, Simone and Rakul surfaced during the investigation…the answer to that is yes”. However, Malhotra hastened to add that the NCB had not prepared any list of Bollywood personalities as had been reported in a section of the media. “There have been questions whether the NCB has prepared a list of 25 Bollywood personalities. The answer to that is no,” Malhotra said. As many as 16 persons have so far been arrested in the Sushant Singh Raput death-related drug case registered by the NCB. Actress Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik are two of the arrested accused in the case. A descendent of the Tagore and Pataudi families, Sara (25) is the daughter of actor Saif Ali Khan and his first wife Amrita Singh and grand-daughter of  late Indian cricket captain MAK Pataudi and actor and former Censor Board chairperson Sharmila Tagore. Sushant and Sara had worked together in the 2018 film Kedarnath, a Hindi romantic drama. Rakul Preet (29) has acted in several Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films, while Simone (29) is a fashion designer and social media influencer. Unconfirmed reports had earlier said that during the course of her prolonged questioning by the NCB ahead of her arrest on September 8, actress Rhea Chakraborty had reportedly told the investigators that actress Sara Ali Khan and Rakul Preet, designer Simone Khambatta, Sushant's friend and former manager Rohini Iyer and filmmaker Mukesh Chhabra consumed narcotics substances. Meanwhile, seven arrested drug peddlers and dealers – arrested by the NCB in the Sushant death-related drug case—were remanded in the NCB or judicial custody for varying periods by a Mumbai court on Monday.

Among the seven remanded in either NCB or judicial custody, Keswani was among the suspected drug peddlers who were arrested in the wake of the arrest of Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik early this month. Alleged drug peddler Anuj Keswani was arrested by the NCB after Kaizan Ebrahim disclosed his name. Kaizan Ebrahim had reportedly  told the investigators that Anuj Keshwani was his supplier of narcotic drugs. Keswani and Kaizan were among the ten persons initially arrested in connection with the drug case registered by the NCB. The other arrested accused in the case are Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, Abbas Lakhani, Karan Arora, Zaid Vilatra, Abdel Basit Parihar, Samuel Miranda and Dipesh Sawant. During the 19-long hours of grilling carried out during a span of three days that led to her arrest on September 8, Rhea reportedly admitted that she had procured drugs for Sushant through her currently arrested brother Showik Chakraborty, that she had acknowledged that she knew about Samuel purchasing drugs for the actor from drug peddler Zaid Vilatra and that she had accepted that she had accepted drug-related WhatsApp chats between her and others However, Rhea – who is currently judicial custody -- has retracted the confessional statement recorded by the NCB ahead of her arrest.

Mamata announces stipend for Hindu priests,"  In an apparent bid to arrest erosion in the Hindu vote base ahead of the next year’s Assembly elections Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced stipend for the Hindu “Sanatani” priests triggering criticism from the opposition BJP, Left and Congress who condemned her policy of “bringing cow belt politics to Bengal.” The new scheme will entail a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000 and free housing for more than 8,000 poor Sanatan Brahmin priests of Bengal. “We had earlier provided land to the Sanatan Brahmin sect to set up an academy at Kolaghat. Many priests in this sect are financially weak. We have decided to help them by providing them with an allowance of Rs 1,000 per month and also free housing under the state government’s housing scheme,” the Chief Minister said. Congratulating the Hindi speaking population on Hindi Diwas she said Bengal was a place for the people of all religions, languages and sects, adding the Government would soon set up a Hindi Academy and a Dalit Sahitya Academy.  “We respect all languages. We have decided to form a new Hindi Academy. We have also decided to set up a Dalit Sahitya Academy. Dalits’ languages have influence on the Bengali language” she said. Reacting to her decision to woo the priests at the fag end of her rule senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha said “this is another mark of Mamata Banerjee’s votebank politics… soon after coming to power she had started stipend for the Muezzims and Imams to mollycoddle the Muslim votes. And now at the fag end of her rule when she knows that the Hindus have felt let down during her rule and the entire Hindu vote has shifted to the BJP she is trying to win them back. “Today she is trying to rectify her mistakes but it will yield noresult. No amount of measures will pacify the dejected Hindu voters because they have known her true face. They will not be fooled by her anymore. She will have to go out of power in the coming elections.” Congress Lok Sabha leader and PCC president Adhir Chowdhury said “when she announced stipend for the Imams after coming to power the Congress had protested saying it was a way to divide the people. Now she is again assuming the same path this time by trying to appease the Brahmins so that the Hindu voters are divided vertically. But people are conscious this time and they will read through her tricks.” CPI(M) Legislature Party leader Sujan Chakrabarty said “Mamata Banerjee has a dirty habit of playing one section of voters against the other. By dividing the voters she wants to win the elections… she talks of secularism and condemns communalism in public. But if this is not playing communal card then what is? She is competing with the BJP in communal politics instead of dealing with unemployment problem, price rise, rising law and order problems…. This only proves that theBJP and TMC are two sides of the same coin.  ",india
"Mahila Morcha stages stir, demands Jaleel's resignation","  Activists of Mahila Morchcha, a frontal organization of the BJP, brought normal life in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram to a grinding halt for hours on Monday as they staged a well planned demonstration in front of the State Secretariat demanding the resignation of Kerala ministers E P Jayarajan  and K T Jaleel who according to them are allegedly involved in gold smuggling and ‘massive corruption’. Despite lathi charge and using of water canons many times , the riot police could not disperse the Morchcha activists  who turned  the police barricades in front of the Secretariat upside down. “We have not seen  this kind of demonstration at least in the recent past. These women activists have done their home work well,” said Shyam Babu Koroth, who has been covering the agitations in front of the Secretariat for  years. Activists of the ABVP, BJYM and the BJP too joined the demonstration but they kept a safe distance from the militant workers of the Mahila Morchcha who were in no mood to listen to the cops who asked them to disperse before the lathi charging. The BJP intensified its ongoing agitation by Monday morning as a section of the media reported about the involvement of minister Jayarajan’s son and wife in gold smuggling and LIFE Mission corruption charges. K Surendran, state chief of the BJP in his media briefing on Monday morning said that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was the epicenter of the entire smuggling and corruption. “We demand the interrogation of Vijayan, his daughter Veena, son Kiran and son-in-law Mohammed Riyaaz in connection with gold smuggling and other corruption charges,” charged Surendran. “These are Devis against a Devil. The real Naari Sakthi is waging a battle against corrupt elements,” said Prof V T Rema, former chief of the Mahila Morchha. The slogans they raised were hitherto unheard of in any agitations in front of the Secretariat, she said.  ",india
Kerala Opp rap CPM Govt for sabotaging scam probe,"  The entire Opposition parties that include the Congress, the BJP and the Muslim League on Monday alleged that the ruling CPI(M) government is trying to sabotage the investigation into the gold smuggling and LIFE Mission cases. Anil Akkara, Congress MLA from Thrissur alleged on Monday that Swapna Suresh and K T Ramees , the kingpins in the gold smuggling cases were admitted to Thrissur Medical College to facilitate communication with each other in the company of A C Moitheen, a Minister in the Pinarayi Vijayan led Government. Moitheen made an unscheduled visit to the hospital when Swapna and Ramees were admitted to the hospital. “The visit of Moideen to the hospital is enmeshed in mystery. His mission was to meet Swapna and Ramees and brief them about the statements made by them to the Cusotoms department and what they should tell during future interrogations,” said Anil. The Congress leader said that there was no need for the minister to visit the hospital at this juncture. The law maker also alleged that Swapna Suresh made phone calls using the mobile phones of the hospital staff. “Though she had complained of chest pain, it has been found that she was all right and there was no need of any concern about her health. Though she was discharged after two days, she was re-admitted to the same hospital for check ups. I understand the medical board found nothing abnormal in her health,” said Anil. P K Feroz, leader of the Muslim League, too came down heavily on the Pinarayi Vijayan government alleging that efforts were underway to subvert the probe into the gold smuggling and Quran import scams. “Now I have got information that Jaleel was seeking the help of Islamic religious leaders to wriggle out of the case,” said Feroze.  Meanwhile Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it was scandalous and “nonsense” to drag the LIFE Mission project into allegations. “The Opposition parties are out to tarnish the image of this government because they know that they would not be able to win the next assembly election ,” said the Chief Minister..

"TMC, Congress play Bengali card on Rhea","  After Bihari and Marathi cards the Bengali card has become the favourite for the politicians in Bengal with both the Congress and the Congress and Trinamool Congress questioning actor Rhea Chakrabarty’s arrest in Sushant Singh Rajput death case “with no prima facie evidence of her having a hand in his demise.” A day after Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Chowdhury raised the issue of a Bengali Brahmin woman being victimized to appease a section of the electorate in Bihar TMC MP and senior advocate Kalyan Banerjee on Monday called BJP a “thoroughly anti-Bengali party which thrives on North Indian politics and sacrifices Bengali interest.” Chowdhury whose party on Monday took out a long procession condemning film Rhea Chakrabarty’s arrest said, “it was done only to appease a section of the Bihari voters ahead of the Assembly elections in that State. Today we can see how a Bengali Brahmin girl is being harassed in Mumbai… she has been sent to jail on false drug charges … whereas the real case is related to SSR’s death in which the CBI and ED has prima facie found no evidence.  This is purely anti-Bengal and we condemn it.” Kalyan Banerjee on Monday attacked the BJP calling it an “anti-Bengali party which is proved once again by the manner they have falsely implicated Rhea Chakrabarty a Bengali Brahmin girl. This will not go down well among the Bengali voters in this States. They will have to account for the torture they perpetrated on Rhea.” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh however said that “Rhea Chakrabarty is not an issue in Bengal … here the TMC’s goonda and syndicate raj is the main issue and Mamata Banerjee will be thrown out of power on thatissue only.”  ",india

"Athawale wants Prez rule in Maha over Kangana, Navy man assault","  Upping the ante over the incidents of assault on a retired Navy officer by Shiv Sainiks and alleged efforts by the Udhav Thackeray Government to “implicate” Kangana Ranaut in a drug case, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale on Sunday rooted for imposition of President’s rule in Maharashtra, even as actress Kangana called on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and sought justice for her. Talking to media persons after meeting the retired Navy Officer Madan Sharma at Kandivli residence in north Mumbai, Athawale said: “I met Mr Sharma and made enquiries about his health. He has suffered an injury in the eye. I have advised him to undergo treatment at Mumbai's top eye-specialist Dr T P Lahane”. Charging that the attack on Sharma was attempt on his life, Athawale said: “The police should have registered offences against the accused under sections 307 (attempt to murder and 326 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of IPC. Since these IPC sections were not invoked, the accused got the bail easily in the case”. Athavale, who is also the president of Republican Party of India (A), said that being the principal ruling party in Maharashtra, it was the responsibility of the Shiv Sena. “But, the Shiv Sena is conducting itself in a vindictive manner. Its workers attacked retired Navy officer and senior citizen Madan Sharma. The Shiv Sena has even defended the attack. The police have not acted sternly against the Shiv Sainiks who attacked Sharma. The accused are on bail now”. Alluding to news reports that the Maharashtra government had ordered an inquiry into the alleged consumption of narcotic substances by Kangana, Athawale also charged the Mumbai police – under the advice of the Maharashtra government – were trying to “implicate” the actress in a drug consumption case. Athawale, it may be recalled, had on Thursday visited Kangana’s Pali Hill bungalow and held an hour-long meeting with the actress. Athavale extended his party’s support to the actress. “Because of the vindictive acts of the Shiv Sena-led MVA government, the atmosphere has vitiated. Under the circumstances, the Centre should dismiss the Maharashtra government and impose President’s rule in the state,” Athawale said. Meanwhile, Kangana created a minor flutter in Mumbai by calling on Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari at Raj Bhavan here on Sunday to seek “justice” for  her in the wake of partial demolition of h4er bungalow at Bandra’s Pali Hill area in north-west Mumbai.   Kangana's sister Rangoli had accompanied the actress to Raj  Bhavan. After her meeting with the Governor, Kanagana tweeted: “A short while ago I met His Excellency the Governor of Maharashtra Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari Ji. I explained my point of view to him and also requested that justice be given to me; it will restore the faith of common citizens and particularly daughters in the system”. Meanwhile, the “Queen” fame actress fired a fresh salvo at the Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut over that reported statement that it was unfortunate that the BJP was “backing” her despite her likening Mumbai Pak-Occupied Kashmir with an eye on the Bihar Assembly polls.Taking a pot shot at Raut, Kangana tweeted: “Wow!! Unfortunate that BJP is protecting someone who busted drug and mafia racket, BJP should instead let Shiv Sena goons break my face,rape or openly lynch me, nahin Sanjay ji? How dare they protect a young woman who is standing against the mafia!!!” On his part, Raut said that the Shiv Sena had stopped talking about the statements and issues relating to Kangana. “But, we are keeping a close watch of the Kangana-related events, who is doing what and which party is behind the whole thing”. Raut’s comment should be seen in the context of Kangana’s statements, the support being extended to her by the Opposition BJP and her meeting with   Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari earlier in the day. Earlier, in his weekly column “Rok tok”  published in the Shiv Sena’s official mouth-piece “Saamana”, Raut slammed Kangana, without naming her but merely describing as an actress, for her objectionable statements against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray whom he referred to in singular term as “Tujhe” and even threatened to expose. It may be recalled that referring to Uddhav Thackeray as “tujhe”, Kangana had on September 9 launched an all out war against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.  “Uddhav Thackeray, tujhe kya lagta hai? (what do you think?)… colluded along with the film mafia, demolished my home and took revenge on me? My home was demolished today, your arrogance will crumble tomorrow,” Kangana had said in a video message on her arrival in Mumbai. In his write-up, Raut expressed surprise that the entire film industry kept quiet over Kangana’s statement. “The film personalities should have come forward and taken a stand against Kangana’s view linking Mumbai to PoK. They should have said it is the opinion of Kangana and not the entire film industry. At least film stars like Akshay Kumar should have spoken against Kangana. Mumbai has given so much to people. But, when it comes to expressing their gratitude to Mumbai, they feel the pain,” Raut wrote. “Thackerays control the state. That being the case, there is no need for the Shiv Sainiks to take to streets to create ruckus over the Marathi Asmita (self-respect) cause,” Raut stated.  ",india

Parents blame politicians for spreading lies about NEET,"  Students committing suicide allegedly due to fear of failure in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test  (NEET) is being blown out of proportion by some political parties in Tamil Nadu, say parents and aspiring medical students in the State. “How come that only students from Tamil Nadu are the ones who resort to the extreme measure?” asks Vijayasree Ramesh, a lawyer cum social activist who is also a doting mother. DMK president M K Stalin had described that NEET was not at all an examination following the reports of suicide by three students from different parts of the State. “They committed suicide even before they appeared in the test. That sounds strange,” said Vijayasree. She said parents should be blamed for the suicides. “They pressurize the children to accomplish their dreams on children. Parents need counselling to handle children,” she said. She was also for counselling the children. “The children aren’t given time to relax or take time off to pursue hobbies or divert their thought once negativity sets in,” said Vijayasree. She blamed parental and peer pressure for this phenomenon. “The crucial ten seconds to commit suicide .. if that’s evaded they can escape suicidal attempts. The parents should not allow children to be alone or lock up their rooms,” said Vijayasree. Vanathi Srinivasan, senior BJP leader has something interesting to tell. “I had launched a free NEET coaching center for students from Coimbatore and Tiruppur. Students from 12 government schools were selected and were offered coaching. Six students made it to all India ranks list. I discontinued the coaching centres when Tamil Nadu Government set up such centres in all districts.  But the DMK, having certain hidden agenda, was against NEET from day one despite their support to the Congress in ushering the system,” said Vanathi Srinivasan.   Vanathi is of the view that the approach of the DMK and the AIADMK was not pro-student. “They are trying to make the students to take up cudgels by spreading falsehoods against NEET,” she said. Vanathi and Vijayasree pointed out that the suicides are reported only from TN and not from anywhere else.  ",india
"Govt issues fresh norms for recovered patients, says exercise, take immunity boosting medicines","  In the wake of reports of health complications faced by Covid-19 survivors, the Government on Sunday issued fresh guidelines recommending the recovered patients to undertake physical exercise and consume chavyanprakash and turmeric milk and other prescribed immunity boosting medicines besides constantly monitoring their health and looking for early signs like a dip in oxygen level or unexplained chest pain. In its new management protocol for patients who have  recovered from Covid-19, the Union Health Ministry on Sunday called for a holistic approach for follow up care and well-being of all recovered patients and said that they must continue Covid appropriate behaviour by use of mask, hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing. The protocol provides an approach for managing patients who have recovered from Covid-19 for care at home. However, the procedure is not meant to be seen as preventive or as a curative therapy. “The recovery period is likely to be longer for patients who suffered from more severe form of the disease and those with pre-existing illness,” it said. At individual level, the protocol suggested drinking adequate amount of warm water (if not contra-indicated), taking immunity promoting AYUSH medicine prescribed by a qualified practitioner of AYUSH and if health permits then regular household work to be done. Immunity promoting AYUSH medicine like mulethi powder, ayush kwath, Samshamani vati and Ashwagandha powder have also been recommended by the Health Ministry in its protocol. It advised people to resume professional work in a graded manner. Daily practice of Yogasana, Pranayama and meditation, as much as health permits or as prescribed, breathing exercises as prescribed by treating physician and daily morning or evening walk at a comfortable pace as tolerated were among other measures. The protocol also called for self-health monitoring at home of temperature, blood pressure, blood sugar (especially, if diabetic), pulse oximetry etc (if medically advised). “If there is persistent dry cough/sore throat, do saline gargles and take steam inhalation. The addition of herbs/spices for gargling/steam inhalation. Cough medications, should be taken on advice of medical doctor or qualified practitioner of Ayush. Look for early warning signs like high grade fever, breathlessness, unexplained chest pain, new onset of confusion, focal weakness,” it said. At the level of community, the ministry said recovered individuals should share their positive experiences with friends and relatives using social media, community leaders, opinion leaders, religious leaders for creating awareness, dispelling myths and stigma. “Take support of community based self-help groups, civil society organizations, and qualified professionals for recovery and rehabilitation process (medical, social, occupational, livelihood). Seek psycho-social support from peers, community health workers, counsellor. If required seek mental health support service,” the protocol said. In the healthcare facility setting, the ministry advised the first follow-up visit (physical/telephonic) should be within seven days after discharge, preferably at the hospital where he/she underwent treatment. “Subsequent treatment/follow up visits may be with the nearest qualified allopathic/AYUSH practitioner/medical facility of other systems of medicine. “Poly-therapy is to be avoided due to potential for unknown drug-drug interaction, which may lead to Serious Adverse Events or Adverse Effects,” it said.

"India’s coal import drops 35% in Aug on lower demand from power, cement players","  India’s coal import declined by 34.9 per cent to 12.46 million tonnes (MT) in August on account of subdued demand for the dry fuel from consuming sectors like power and cement.   The country imported 19.14 MT of coal in August last year, according to provisional compilation by mjunction, based on monitoring of vessels’ positions and data received from shipping companies.   Mjunction, a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL, is a B2B e-commerce company that also publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals. Also, the first five months of the current fiscal saw 32.51 per cent decline in coal import at 73.08 MT, over 108.29 MT during the year-ago period, it said.  “Although there has been a modest recovery in coal-consuming sectors such as power and cement, coal stock continues to be ample and hence import demand subdued. If we go by the current trend, coal imports may see a significant decline this year,” it said.  Of the total imports in August, non-coking coal’s shipment was at 8.87 MT and coking coal at 2.18 MT.  Coal India (CIL), which accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output, has been mandated by the government to replace at least 100 million tonnes of imports with domestically-produced coal in the ongoing fiscal.     To boost coal demand, the government has announced a slew of measures like increased supply for linkage consumers.

Kangana faces ire for anti-Uddhav comment,"  Within days after she made “objectionable” comments against Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut faced backlash on Saturday, as the ruling Shiv Sena workers took out a procession of a donkey with Kangana’s poster wrapped on it and later burnt her effigy at Miraj town in western Maharashtra. The Shiv Sainiks staged a massive protest against Kangana at Miraj in Sangli district of western Maharashtra. As part of the protest, they took out a donkey procession with a poster of the actress wrapped over the animal. The protesters raised slogans against Kangana for her “objectionable” remarks against Udhav Thackeray and the Mumbai police. The protesters said that the actress, through her remarks, had insulted “self-respect” of Maharashtra. At the end of the procession, the protestors burnt an effigy of the actress. Saturday was the second occasion when the Shiv Sainiks staged a protest against Kangana. Earlier the Sena activists had burnt her effigy and pictures in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Thane, Palghar, Nashik and other cities. On its part, the BJP too has distanced from Kangana’s “anti-Mumbai” comments. Kangana has come under fire from various quarters for controversial statements comparing Mumbai to “Pak-Occupied Kashmir” and saying “it seems Mumbai is addicted to blood” and dubbing Bollywood as an 'Islam-dominated' film industry. There have also been protests erupted in Mumbai and other cities against the actress Through a series of tweets put out during and after the BMC workers demolished her office at Bandra’s Pali Hill area in north-west Mumbai on Wednesday last, Kangana had among other things come up with a “..... tujhe kya lagta hai?”  dare for Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, whom she had threatened to expose.    It may be recalled that referring to Uddhav Thackeray as “tujhe”, Kangana had on September 9 launched an all out war against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.  “Uddhav Thackeray, tujhe kya lagta hai? (what do you think?)… colluded along with the film mafia, demolished my home and took revenge on me? My home was demolished today, your arrogance will crumble tomorrow,” Kangana had said in a video message on her arrival in Mumbai. As the BMC was in the midst of the demolition of alleged illegal structures in her bungalow, Kangana -- who was on her way from Himachal Pradesh to Mumbai, had compared her office to Ram mandir and said that Babar is demolishing it. She compared BMC officials to “Babur army” and said that history would repeat itself and she will reconstruct her 'mandir'. “This is the wheel of time, remember, it never stays the same,” she said, adding that she could sense as to what could have happened with Kashmiri pandits. “Today, I promise that I will make a film on Kashmir like Ayodhya.....Uddhav Thackeray….I feel good that it has happened to me…it has a meaning,” she had said. In some more tweets out during the day,  Kangana had said: “Come Udhav Thakeray and Karan Johar Gang you broke my work place come now break my house then break my face and body, I want world to see clearly what you anyway do underhand, whether I live or die I will expose you regardless”. “My office was suddenly declared illegal in the last 24 hours, they have destroyed everything inside including furniture and lights and now I am getting threats they will come to my house and break it as well,I am glad my judgement of the movie mafia’s favourite world’s best CM was right,” she had tweeted. “There is no illegal construction in my house, also the government has banned any demolitions in Covid till September 30, Bullywood watch now this is what Fascism looks like,” Kangaa had tweeted.

No part of Afghanistan is untouched by our 400-plus development projects. Confident that this civilisational relationship will continue to grow,” he said. Last month, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani agreed to release 400 Taliban prisoners, paving the way for the beginning of the long-awaited peace process aimed at ending nearly two-decades of conflict in the war-torn country. India has been a major stakeholder in peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested USD two billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country. It has been backing a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. Moreover, India was keenly following the evolving political situation after the US inked a peace deal with the Taliban in February. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington’s 18-year war in the country.  The US has lost over 2,400 soldiers in Afghanistan since late 2001. India has all along maintained that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate. It also called upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of all people in that country including those from the minority community for a prosperous and safe future. The external affairs ministry said Jaishankar’s participation was in response to an invitation extended to him by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar, Mohammad bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. A senior official delegation led by J P Singh, Joint Secretary (PAI) in the Ministry of External Affairs participated in the inaugural ceremony.  ",india

"Sebi must blacklist board members, officials found guilty of governance deficit: Narayana Murthy","  Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy on Monday suggested that market regulator Sebi must blacklist board members and officials found guilty of governance deficit, and the compensation paid to them be recovered. Murthy also asserted that shareholders must also be provided access to full details of the investigation carried out after any whistleblower complaint, unless it contains information that could provide advantage to competitors. Speaking at an All India Management Association (AIMA) event on corporate governance, Murthy said if investigation into a whistleblower complaint concludes that the board and the officers of the company did not perform their fiduciary duties and contributed to a governance deficit by omission or commission, they are just asked to resign. ""Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) must blacklist these board members and officers. The shareholders must vote them out. In addition, the shareholders must claw back 100 per cent of the compensation or the fee received by the board and the officers during the tenure of the incident i.e. the date when the incident occurred to the time the investigation is complete - reported by the whistleblower,"" he said. He noted that whistleblowing should not be an act of revenge by a disgruntled employee, and the whistleblower must substantiate his or her complaint with data and facts. Stating that a corporation must provide total protection to whistleblowers against vendetta by the bosses, Murthy said an important duty of a board is protecting and enhancing the reputation of the company and discharging its fiduciary responsibilities. ""Therefore, addressing a whistleblower complaint in a transparent and trust-enhancing manner is a must. If the complaint is against a middle or a low level employee, an internal committee consisting of senior employees not connected with the accused and committed to total fairness and transparency, should be sufficient,"" he said. Murthy added that if the complaint is against any member of the board including the chairman or the CEO, the tendency of most Indian boards is to investigate such complaints themselves assisted by an outside law firm, pay them and obfuscate the issue. ""This is not a good idea because you cannot be the judge, the jury and the defendant,"" he said. He said the boards of some globally-reputed companies totally recuse themselves from the investigation of the complaint in such situations and top ten shareholders and highly-respected individuals from the society are brought in to investigate the whistleblower's complaint. Stating that transparency is an important tenet of good governance, Murthy said a shareholder has an unalienable right of access to every piece of information concerning an investigation. ""The full details of the investigation should be provided on the website of the company so that every shareholder has access to it. The investigating committee or its experts should provide every document of the investigation and answer every question,"" he said. Murthy added that the only two exceptions to this rule are that there should not be any selective disclosure provided to any one set of shareholders, and that any business information that provides a competitive advantage to the company vis- -vis its competitors in the marketplace cannot be disclosed to any shareholder. Interestingly, Infosys - in October last year - had informed stock exchanges of having received anonymous whistleblower complaints alleging certain unethical practices by the top management. It then started a probe into the matter and roped in external investigators. Later, the company had said the audit committee had found no evidence of financial impropriety or executive misconduct, giving a clean chit to the top management. In 2017, Infosys had witnessed a protracted stand-off between its high profile founders and the previous management over allegations of governance lapses and issues relating to severance package doled out to former executives, including ex-CFO Rajiv Bansal. After the tussle, the then CEO Vishal Sikka quit followed by some board members. Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani was then brought in as Chairman to steer the company, and Salil Parekh was appointed as the CEO in January 2018. Murthy, delivering the keynote, said corporate governance levels in India have improved considerably in the last three decades but there have been a few instances of serious governance deficits during the last five years. He noted that the primary functions of a corporate board include ensuring a robust quality growth of both the top line and the bottom line of the company, protecting and enhancing the reputation of the company as well as reviewing, critiquing and improving the strategy presented by the management. He added that the Board needs to recommend a fair and performance-based compensation to the CXOs and other officers of the company after consulting key, knowledgeable shareholders and create a succession plan for the CXOs and key officers of the company. The board also needs to identify risks and take timely action to mitigate them, put in place systems of information, control, checks and balances, and make sure that they are working and ensuring full compliance of regulations required by every statutory authority of the land. Murthy pointed out that managerial remuneration has to be a fair multiple of the compensation of the lowest level employee in the company and said if the lowest paid employee's remuneration was Rs 2-3 lakh a year, the CEO remuneration should be Rs 70-80 lakh.

Google forced Paytm to roll back cashback campaign which is legal in India’,"  Global internet giant Google’s Play store rules forced Paytm to roll back a UPI cashback campaign which is legal in India, digital payments company Paytm claimed on Sunday. The company in a blog alleged that it was arm-twisted to take down its campaign while Google Pay has been running similar cricket-based promotions. Google had blocked Paytm on its Play store following a policy update on September 18, ahead of the IPL cricket tournament, to disallow apps that support any unregulated gambling but restored the mobile app after a few hours after it rolled back the campaign. The homegrown financial services firm Paytm said that it was forced to comply with Google’s mandate to remove the UPI cashback and scratch cards campaign to get re-listed on the Android Play Store. “Offering both is legal in India, and cashback was being given following all rules and regulations set by the government,” Paytm said. The digital payments firm alleged that it was “arm-twisted” by the search engine major to comply with its biased app Play Store policies “that are meant to artificially create Google’s market dominance.” Paytm in the blog said that Google Pay has started its Tez Shots Campaign which clearly says, “Score Runs to earn assured rewards worth up to Rs 1 lakh” at the beginning of this cricket season itself. No immediate comments were received from Google on the subject.  Paytm in its blog said in the Tez Shots game a user can play as many times as they want and earn vouchers that they can unlock at each milestone. Finally, they qualify for a lucky draw through which they get assured tickets up to Rs 1 lakh with any qualifying payment. For different scores starting from 50 to all the way to 1000 plus they also earn rewards and discounts on different services that they avail via the Google Pay app, Paytm said in the blog.

"21 States accept Rs 97,000 cr borrowing proposal","  As many as 21 States, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.   The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.  Finance Ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.  The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.  GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs, as per the GST Act, only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.  In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.  Of this, as per Centre’s calculation, shortfall of about Rs  97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of COVID-19 on states’ revenues.  The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.  The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.  They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.  The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.  The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states -- West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu -- have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.  While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.  Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.  The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.  He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.  The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019.  ",business

RS approves amendments to insolvency law,"  Decision on extending the suspension of relevant provisions will be taken next week: Fin Min Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed amendments to the insolvency law for suspension of fresh insolvency proceedings for at least six months starting March 25 amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman saying a decision on extending the suspension of relevant provisions will be taken next week. In the wake of the COVID-19 situation, the government decided to suspend the provisions starting from March 25 for six months by promulgating an ordinance in June. Default on repayments from March 25, the day when the nationwide lockdown began to curb coronavirus infections, would not be considered for initiating insolvency proceedings for at least six months. The six-month period is ending next week.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, seeks to replace the ordinance issued in June, was passed by a voice vote after a brief discussion.  Replying to the debate, Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the suspension of provisions will end next week. “At the moment, amendment to the Code gives me a provision to only extend till one year. If at all, because it is coming to an end on September 25 this year, September 24 itself we have to make an announcement about what is going to happen. But even if I do, it means by March it should be ending...,” the minister said. The minister also clarified that insolvency proceedings against corporates defaulting on loans prior to March 25 will continue and the amendment will not stall those cases. A majority of the opposition parties also supported the bill but urged the government to provide interest waiver on loans to farmers and poor people suffering due to the COVID-19 crisis. During the debate on the bill, many members expressed fears over its possible misuse by corporates even as they hoped that it will help in reviving the economy. On members’ queries regarding liability of personal guarantors in the IBC, Sitharaman said the corporate debtor often has guarantors. “So, for comprehensive corporate insolvency resolution and liquidation we felt it was necessary that the insolvency of the corporate debtor as well as its guarantors are considered together to whatever extent it is possible,” Sitharaman said. On queries about the urgency to bring the ordinance in the first place, Sitharaman said that “between sessions if there is a need for ordinance because the ground situation demands it, I would think a responsive government’s duty is to at least use the ordinance to show that we are there with the people of India.” “So to that extent, I am sure the House will appreciate that as and when the government decides for ordinance it is because of that, and whenever the next session happens we come back,” she said. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister said, businesses faced trouble. So it was decided “that it was better to suspend Sections 7, 9 and 10 of IBC so that we can prevent corporate persons, which are experiencing distress on account of the unprecedented situation, being pushed into insolvency proceedings”. Sections 7, 9 and 10 deal with initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process by financial creditor, operational creditor and corporate debtor, respectively. The minister further said the IBC is a critical part of business now, and cited data to show how the code had performed. Citing data for NPAs of commercial banks during 2018-19, she informed the House that Lok Adalats recovered 5.3 per cent, Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) recovered 3.5 per cent and SARFAESI recovered 14.5 per cent. On the other hand, IBC ensured 42.5 per cent of recovery. Sitharaman further said that most of the resolutions are happening to make the company to be a going concern only. “Priority is to keep the company to be a going concern rather than to liquidate them at the earliest,” she said adding that 258 companies were saved from going bankrupt through the IBC process, while 965 firms went for liquidation. “... 258 companies were rescued which means employment is back again with them. Companies which have been liquidated in total, three-fourths of them were defunct and were also given liquidation solution and therefore at least loss of employment was reduced,” she said. According to her, 258 companies rescued had assets of Rs 96,000 crore and the 965 companies sent for liquidation had assets of Rs 38,000 crore.  ",business

Yesterday you called me Chokra and I took credit for it. I come from Himachal and i am proud of being called as Chokra,” said Thakur. Chowdhury said he meant Balak (small boy). “You yesterday adopted an aggressive line. You are just a Balak and should not do that by commenting on great people like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru,” he said. Replying to the debate, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also took objection to Chowdhury ridiculing Thakur. “He is young. But he is fourth time MP. Adhir ji, you are leader of the Opposition party and should not use such words.” The Finance Minister also objected to opposition terming the PM Cares Fund as “non-transparent”.  ",business

India Ratings gives ‘negative' outlook for banking sector in 2HFY21,"  India Ratings and Research has revised its outlook on the banking sector to 'negative' from 'stable' for 2HFY21. The ratings agency Ind-Ra said this revision was done in view of an expected spike in stressed assets, higher credit costs, weaker earnings on account of interest reversals and lower fee income, and muted growth prospects. Even the capital buffers for most public sector banks (PSBs) remain modest, it said. As per Ind-Ra's bear case, the spike in stressed assets due to the pandemic is expected to double the credit costs for banking system than estimated pre-Covid-19 levels for FY21. Consequently, Ind-Ra revised the rating outlook on PSBs to 'negative' for 2HFY21. ""PSBs' modest capital buffers are expected to deplete further in FY21, due to provisioning requirements. Also, pre-Covid profitability expectations for FY21 would be belied and most banks are likely to report net losses,"" the agency said in a statement. ""They may also need to continue to build-up their provision cover in FY22 for restructured assets as some of the restructured assets could turn NPA in FY23.

"Britannia Industries settles case with Sebi, pays over Rs 46 lakh","  Britannia Industries has paid over Rs 46 lakh towards settlement charge to markets regulator Sebi to settle a case of alleged failure to carry out due diligence before giving effect to transmission of shares and issuance of demand draft. Britannia Industries Ltd allegedly violated Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations (LODR). Sebi agreed to settle proposed adjudication proceedings in the case pertaining to violation of LODR norms after it was approached by Britannia Industries with a plea under the settlement regulations ""without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusion of law"". In a settlement order passed on Thursday, Sebi said it has disposed of the adjudication proceedings initiated against the applicant (Britannia Industries). The case pertains to Sujit Kumar Gupta who held certain shares of Britannia Industries and died in 1985. Britannia Industries had forwarded a letter received from the legal heir of Gupta to its registrar and transfer agent, Sharepro Services (I) Pvt Ltd, wherein information about the shares held in the name of Gupta was requested. Subsequently, Sharepro received a letter from Balram Mukheijee, enclosing a document, purportedly a court order passed in 1985, which said he was entitled to certain shares held by Gupta. Thereafter, 33,750 shares were transferred to Balram in terms of the court order. Britannia was also a party to the purported suit filed by Balram, the order noted. The investigation conducted by Sebi revealed that the court order as submitted by Balram was a forged document. Therefore, it was alleged that Britannia Industries did not carry out the required due diligence before giving effect to transmission of shares. The transfers were allegedly approved without proper documents, the settlement order noted. In addition, Britannia Industries allegedly exhibited negligence in issuance of demand draft. It was alleged that in spite of being aware of the demise of Gupta, demand draft in favour of 'Sujit Kumar Gupta' was issued upon Britannia's instruction by HDFC Bank, which was subsequently encashed by some other Sujit Kumar Gupta. However, Britannia Industries, through an application filed in January 2020,  proposed to settle the proceedings. Thereafter, high powered advisory committee of the regulator considered the settlement terms proposed by Britannia and recommended the case for settlement upon payment of Rs 46,21,875. After approval of the recommendation by the panel of whole time members of Sebi, Britannia Industries remitted the settlement amount in August. ""In view of the acceptance of the settlement terms and receipt of settlement amount as above by Sebi, the instant adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee (Britannia Industries).... Are disposed of,"" Sebi said. However, the regulator can restore the proceedings under certain circumstances, which include failure of the firm to comply with the settlement order or if the firm is found to have made untrue disclosures.

GST rate on cars lower than pre-GST regime; auto cost should cut royalty payments: Fin Min sources,"  Auto companies should cut costs by reducing royalty payments to their parent companies abroad instead of asking the government to reduce GST, finance ministry sources said on Thursday, responding to criticism on high taxes in India.  Most globally established companies in the sector have flourished in the current taxation and regulatory regime, which is evident from the huge royalty payouts made by Indian partners to their foreign parent firms, they added.  Toyota Motor Corp is not looking at further expansion in India due to the country's high taxes, the firm's vice chairman of India unit Shekar Viswanathan had reportedly said in an interview earlier this week.

Gujarat approves letter of intent for world's first CNG terminal at Bhavnagar,"  The Gujarat government on Tuesday approved a letter of intent (LOI) for the world's first Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) terminal at Bhavnagar port with a proposed investment of Rs 1,900 crore, an official statement said.  The LOI was approved by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and it will be handed over to the consortium of companies to develop the CNG terminal, it added.The project will be developed jointly by UK-headquartered Foresight Group, Mumbai-based Padmanabh Mafatlal Group and a Netherland-based consortium. The Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) had signed a memorandum of understanding with Foresight Group to set up this port terminal at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit held in January 2019, the Government release said. In principle approval was given by the Gujarat government in November 2019, and now with the issuing of LOI, the private players will have to take all the necessary permission before starting the work, it said. Apart from the CNG terminal, the investors would also develop a Ro-Ro terminal (for roll-on/roll-off ships), liquid cargo terminal and container terminal at Bhavnagar port with a cumulative investment of Rs 1,900 crore. The proposed CNG port terminal will have a capacity of 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA). The GMB manages the existing port at Bhavnagar, having a capacity to handle 3 MMTPA cargo.  While the consortium would invest Rs 1,300 crore in the first phase, Rs 600 crore will be invested in the second phase. To develop CNG and other terminals on the north side of the existing port would require major modifications in the existing infrastructure, including dredging in the water channel of the port basin, construction of two lock gates and off-shore infrastructure for CNG transportation, the release said.

BPCL may buyout Oman Oil stake in Bina refinery before its sale,"  Sale-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) may buy out the entire stake of OQ, the erstwhile Oman Oil Company (OOC), in their Madhya Pradesh joint venture, the Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL). Government sources said that BORL became a subsidiary of BPCL in March this year and the next step now is to convert it into a 100 per cent subsidiary before government stake in the company is sold to a strategic partner. For this to happen, it is essential that BPCL buys out OQ's stake in the refinery before its own sale process goes off the ground. This is important as BPCL's valuation may be impacted if a joint venture remains in its fold even after new owners take control. BPCL and OQ were 50:26 joint venture partners in BORL till March when BPCL converted 13 per cent of its earlier investment made in compulsorily convertible debentures and share warrants of BORL or Bina refinery. This made BORL a subsidiary of BPCL as its stake in the refinery increased to 63 per cent from 50 per cent earlier. The investment in convertible debenture was equivalent to 24 per cent additional equity stake in BORL. Sources said, if BPCL converts the remaining 11 per cent of convertible debentures to equity, its holding in BORL will increase to 74 per cent given that OQ has not shown interest in increasing stake in BORL by putting in additional equity. This will leave 26 per cent equity with OQ that the company will negotiate to buy to complete 100 per cent acquisition of Bina Refinery. OQ could not be reached for comments. The refinery has expanded its capacity from 6 million tonne (mt) per annum to 15 million tonne in two phases. While OOC had agreed to provide funds in the first phase of expansion to 7.8 mt with an investment of Rs 3,500 crore, it was unwilling to participate in the second phase that needed another Rs 30,000 crore over next five to six years. BORL was formed as an equal joint venture company way back in 1993. However, following inordinate delays in the implementation of the project, OOC froze its investment in the company at Rs 75 crore for a two per cent equity stake. In 2009, OOC paid a 50 per cent premium for a re-entry into the Rs 11,397-crore Bina refinery project, picking up 26 per cent stake.  ",business

GST compensation due to States at Rs 1.51 L cr,"  The GST collection during April-August declined on account of Covid-19 induced lockdown, and the compensation due to States stands at over Rs 1.51 lakh crore, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said on Monday.  The provisional GST compensation due to states/UTs for 2020-21 was highest for Maharashtra at Rs 22,485 crore, followed by Karnataka (Rs 13,763 crore), Uttar Pradesh (Rs 11,742 crore), Gujarat (Rs 11,563 crore) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 11,269 crore).  The compensation due to West Bengal stands at Rs 7,750 crore, Kerala (Rs  7,077 crore), Punjab (RRs 6,959 crore), Delhi (Rs 6,931 crore), Rajasthan (Rs  6312 crore), Telangana (Rs  5,424 crore) and Chhattisgarh (Rs 2,827 crore).  The total provisional GST compensation due to 31 states and UTs for 2020-21 put together stands at Rs 1,51,365 crore, as per data shared in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.  Thakur said the issue of pending compensation and future course of action to meet the shortfall was discussed in the 41st GST Council meeting on August 27 wherein states were given two options to meet their GST compensation shortfall for current fiscal year from market borrowing.  “It was also decided that states will give their preference views thereon. Thereafter on finalisation of scheme, states can choose either Option 1 or Option 2 and accordingly, their compensation, borrowing, repayment etc will be dealt as per their individual choice,” he added. In the current fiscal year, states are staring at a staggering Rs  2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.  Of this, as per the Centre’s calculation, about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and the rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states’ revenues. The Centre late last month gave two options to states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market and also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.  In reply to a separate question, Thakur said the total net GST target for the Centre has been pegged at Rs 6,90,500 crore for 2020-21 in the Union Budget.  The actual net GST collection for the Centre till August 2020 is Rs 1,81,050 crore, which shows 26.2 per cent of the Budget Estimates(BE).  “The BEs for FY 2020-21 of GST in the Union Budget, 2020-21 were projected on the basis of assumption of higher growth of GDP, however as per CSO, MoS&PI ... The Nominal GDP for Q1 (April-June), 2020-21 shows a contraction of 22.6 per cent which is one of the major reasons for revenue shortfall in GST. “Other reasons for low tax collection inter-alia include nationwide lockdown measures implemented since March 2020 consequent to global COVID-19 pandemic which led to limited economic activities, extension of GST return filings timelines without payment of interest, late fee or penalty etc,” Thakur said.

However, the broader markets outperformed, especially the small-cap index, after Sebi tweaked MF norms for multi-cap funds. This Sebi measure would require more exposure to small-cap stocks in most multi-cap funds, leading to the current buying interest.   “Global cues were also mostly positive on renewed vaccine optimism. Inspite of all the optimism, a correction due to valuations or various uncertainties cannot be ruled out and volatility is expected to continue.

SBI Card to enrol ‘delinquent’ customers in restructuring plans: MD,"  SBI Card is in the process of enrolling “delinquent” customers, who did not repay after the end of moratorium, in the RBI restructuring scheme or its own repayment plan to provide them more time for repayments, a top company official said. Due to the moratorium, a number of customers had not been paying for the first three months and the company treated them as standard accounts in line with the entire industry. However, since then, as the first moratorium ended, SBI Card made it a customer-led enrolment in the second moratorium in which a lot of customers did not enrol, SBI Card Managing Director & CEO Ashwini Kumar Tewari said. “Therefore, we had a large chunk of customers who came out of the moratorium. A lot of them paid up but many of them did not pay also. And these became what we call as more delinquent customers. “So with these delinquent customers, we are now working to enrol them either into the RBI restructuring scheme or our own repayment plans so that they get more time and better interest rate to pay their dues,” Tewari, who took charge over a month ago, told PTI in an interview. According to the company, it had Rs 7,083 crore under moratorium in May which came down to Rs 1,500 crore in June. Those who would be availing the company’s restructuring plan will have a benefit over the RBI restructuring plan as SBI Card will not report such cases to the credit scoring agency CIBIL. In March, the RBI had allowed the first three-month moratorium on payment of all term loans due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Later on, it was extended for another three months till August 2020.The process of restructuring is going on currently, Tewari said, adding a large number of accounts are to be enrolled and the company needs to make a 10 per cent provisioning on these accounts as per the RBI guidelines. Besides, there are some accounts that surely have become NPA (non-performing) due to the pandemic and therefore additional provisions need to be created for that, he said. “However, we will be very cautious, even if we get to that number (provisioning), we would still like to provide more because the future is still uncertain,” he added. Tewari said that in the second and the third quarter going forward, the company will be able to handle the situation better. “And of course it will be reverted to normal if the vaccine is made available and if the COVID-19 comes under control. I think from towards the end of quarter three and (beginning) quarter four, we will be in a much better shape,” he said further.  ",business

‘Pandemic created tech opportunities in customs clearance’,"  The coronavirus pandemic has forced every sector to embrace technology, and logistics and customs have been no different, as sector players say that it has created more opportunities for technology in customs clearance making the process less cumbersome. Lancy Barboza, Managing Director, Flomic Group, a freight services company, said that in the past few months the pandemic has created serious disruptions in cross border trade and freight movements, but it has also created fresh opportunities to leverage technology for efficient faceless and paperless operations of the customs. Welcoming the government’s new initiative,’Turant Customs’, Barboza said that the programme to offer a ‘faceless, contactless and paperless’ service, would lead to speedy clearances, transparency in decision making, ease of doing business and reduction in physical contact. “Even though there are still occasional glitches, which hinders the smooth clearance, the initiative and the resolve of the government to push ahead with the paperless and faceless process will go a long way in weeding out additional expenses and delays in Custom clearance activity” he said. Elucidating the ease in clearance, Rajesh Neelakanta, ED & CEO, BVC Logistics said: “In one such practice of Customs clearance process that BVC helped in changing, we created an application for filing of shipment details, for both exports and imports by the exporter/importer from the comfort of their offices, linked to ICEGATE - the Customs portal, thus establishing contactless interface for their shipment’s EXIM process.” This helped eliminate the physical movement of the customers’ personnel from their offices to the customs station, Neelakanta said. “We also have introduced shipment details’ remote uploading for freight management and thus helping the EXIM trade to become more efficient and productive. We are working on a couple of more such technological innovations, all aimed at making the EXIM experience of our customers seamless,” he added. Ambrish Kumar, Founder and Group CEO, AAA 2 Innovate Private Ltd noted that in the past couple of years, the government has been keen on bringing such reforms and they would help the country to enter the top 50 rankings of The World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Index. The ‘Turant Customs’ will augment effortless cross border trade as the shipping bills will be electronically sent to the exporters with a secure QR code, he said, adding that the exporters can manage their bank account and authorised dealer (AD) Code digitally and register at ICEGATE without approaching a Customs Officer.

Fuel demand falls again after hope in July,"  India's fuel demand is showing signs of stress with a sharp fall in August, the biggest monthly decline since April when the Covid-related lockdown brought economic activity to a standstill. Coronavirus surge continues in the country and at local levels lockdowns continue affecting a real pick up in economic activity. The sales of petroleum products (refined products such as petrol, diesel, ATF etc) have registered a 16 per cent decline to 14.39 million tonnes in August this year as compared to the same month last year. The fall is also over previous month of July at 7.5 per cent, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas showed. This is the sharpest fall in demand since April. What is worrisome is the sale of diesel has also fallen in August. Diesel is considered a barometer of economic activity in the country and accounts for about 40 per cent of overall sales of petroleum products. Diesel consumption, fell by about 12 per cent to 4.85 million tonnes in August from 5.51 million tonnes in July. The decline has also been witnessed in the case of petrol which fell by 7.4 per cent from a year earlier to 2.38 million tonnes. However, petrol sales have risen 5.3 per cent from 2.26 million tonnes in July, as the Unlock phase and continued restrictions on public transport have pushed up use of personal vehicles.

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has initiated the process to sell 15-20 per cent stake in Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp (IRCTC) via offer for sale (OFS) and had last month invited bids from merchant bankers by September 10. The last date of submission of bids has been extended till September 14, the DIPAM, which manages the government share sale, said. The Government currently holds 87.40 per cent stake in v:moIRCTC. To meet Sebi’s public holding norm, the Government has to lower its stake in the company to 75 per cent.

Sebi raises minimum investment corpus in equities to 75 pc for multicap funds,"  Markets regulator Sebi on Friday tweaked asset allocation framework for multicap mutual funds, asking such funds to have a minimum corpus of 75 per cent invested in equities as against the present mandate of 65 per cent. Further, such funds will have to make a minimum investment of 25 per cent each in equity and related instruments of largecap, midcap and smallcap companies, Sebi said in a circular. All the existing multicap funds will ensure compliance with the provisions within one month from the date of publishing of the next list of stocks by industry body Amfi (Association of Mutual Funds in India), that is January 2021, it added. “In order to diversify the underlying investments of multicap funds across the large, mid and smallcap companies and be true to label, it has been decided to partially modify the scheme characteristics of multicap fund,” the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said. At present, multicap funds need to invest 65 per cent of total assets in equity and its related securities. Besides, there is no restriction on the exposure such funds need to make in large, mid and smallcap stocks, therefore, experts believe most of the multicap funds have higher allocation towards largecap, and residual exposure in mid and smallcap. “Now with this circular in effect, we will see most funds increasing their exposure in mid and smallcaps, while largecap already had lion’s share,” Samco Group Head - RankMF Omkeshwar Singh said.Jimeet Modi, founder and CEO, of Samco Group said the new provision will lead to increased buying in mid or smallcap by multicap MFs to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. This will be a disruption opposite to the one we saw in October 2018, when Sebi first introduced scheme categorisation. That had led to outflows from small and midcaps. The inverse will happen this time, he added.  ",business

Moody's revises India's FY21 GDP contraction to (-)11.5%,"  Moody's Investor Service on Friday enhanced the contraction rate of India's FY21 GDP to (-)11.5 per cent from an earlier estimate of (-)4 per cent. The revision comes days after India reported a massive 23.9 per cent contraction in the first quarter GDP of the current fiscal. Consequently, Moody's revised the forecast for the next financial year 2021-22. It now estimates a growth of 10.6 per cent from a rise of 8.7 per cent, which was predicted earlier. ""The country's policymaking institutions have struggled to mitigate and contain these risks, which have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Mutually reinforcing risks from deeper stresses in the economy and financial system could lead to a more severe and prolonged erosion in fiscal strength, exerting further pressure on the credit profile,"" a Moody's statement said. Moody's had earlier downgraded India's sovereign rating to Baa3 with a negative outlook. The statement on Friday said that the negative outlook reflects mutually reinforcing downside risks from potentially deeper stresses in the economy and the financial system that could lead to a more severe and prolonged erosion in fiscal strength than currently projected. Persistent growth challenges, including weak infrastructure, rigidities in labour, land and product markets and rising financial sector risks continue to constrain the economy's potential, it said, adding that these structural weaknesses may impair the economy's recovery from domestic or external shocks to a greater extent than presently assumed. Moreover, the nature of stress among non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) and banks is still being revealed and may prove deeper and broader than we have assessed so far. The materialisation of economic and financial system risks would be mutually reinforcing, and a deeper and more prolonged credit crunch would constrain GDP growth further, which would increase pressure on financial institutions' balance sheets. ""Should downside risks to growth or the financial system materialise, negative consequences for India's fiscal strength would follow. The longer the period of relatively subdued growth, the more likely that India's debt burden will continue to rise,"" it said. The materialisation of further contingent liabilities for the government, in the event of renewed financial support to financial institutions, would only add to the debt burden. As per the statement, a rating upgrade is unlikely in the near future. However, it noted that Moody's would change the outlook on India's rating to stable if economic developments and policy actions were to raise confidence that real and nominal growth will rise to sustainably higher rates than currently projected. Measures which enhance financial stability by strengthening the supervision, regulation and capitalisation of the financial sector would support such a move. Commensurate action to halt and reverse the rise in the debt trajectory, even slowly, would also promote a stable outlook, it said. ""Further evidence that self-reinforcing economic and financial risks are rising would put downward pressure on the rating,"" it said. India's Baa3 government bond rating reflects ""a2"" economic strength, ""ba1"" institutions and governance strength, ""b2"" fiscal strength, and ""ba"" susceptibility to event risk, said the statement.

Govt willing to raise unconditional 0.5% borrowing limit,"  The Centre is willing to provide further borrowing flexibility to states to help break the deadlock and allow their participation in the new GST compensation formula put on the table.Government sources said that the unconditional borrowing limit for states could be raised by another 0.5 per cent if they agree on the new GST compensation options suggested by the Centre. Under Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, states are allowed to borrow up to three per cent of gross state domestic product (GSDP) to bridge the fiscal deficit. An additional, two per cent borrowings with both conditional and unconditional elements has been added recently under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package. With Covid-19 inflicted revenue shortfall and rising GST compensation load, the Centre has given new options to compensate states for shortfall in their revenue due to GST switchover. The two options given by the Centre under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package allows flexibility to the states to make additional borrowings to meet their shortfall in GST compensation.  ",business
Retail inflation will come down to below 4% only after December: SBI Report,"  Attributing the recent surge in retail inflation to huge government procurement and supply disruptions on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, an SBI report said that the price rise was likely to come down to below 4 per cent only after December.    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate during August, the data for which is yet to be released, was likely to remain at about 7 per cent, said SBI Ecowrap. The data is scheduled to be released on Monday. According to government data, the retail inflation rose to 6.93 per cent in July, mainly driven by rising prices of food items likevegetables, pulses, meat and fish. It was 3.15 per cent in the corresponding month last year.  “We expect August inflation numbers to be elevated at around 7 per cent or even higher and if the base effect is the primary reason, inflation could only come down to below 4 per cent possibly beyond December,” the SBI report said. However, the report further said that it looks difficult to believe that supply disruptions would normalise against the huge upsurge in pandemic in rural areas and this now poses an upside risk to inflation numbers.  “We are thus less hopeful of any rate cut in current fiscal/at best 25 bps as February MPC meeting would consider December inflation only,” it said.  The Reserve Bank of India, which mainly factors in retail inflation while arriving at its monetary policy, had kept the short-term lending rate unchanged to help tame inflation last month.  The report postulate that the jump in food prices is largely because of huge procurement by government and supply disruption that pushed up prices of cereal, potato, tomato and protein items.  It further said as inflation targeting comes up for review in 2021, “we believe, one way to make inflation targeting successful in the Indian context as time goes by is to reach the 4 per cent target over a particular business cycle rather than for a particular date...”  ",business
Crisil projects 9% GDP contraction in FY21; says Govt not providing adequate direct fiscal support,"  The Indian economy will contract by 9 per cent in 2020-21 as the coronavirus infections are yet to peak and the Government is not providing adequate direct fiscal support, ratings agency Crisil said on Thursday.  In May, Crisil had estimated the economy to contract by 5 per cent. The latest projection comes days after official data for the June quarter showed a contraction of 23.9 per cent in the economy. Crisil said the 9 per cent contraction will be the highest since the 1950s.  The government had announced a Rs 20 lakh crore relief package but the actual new spending was less than 2 per cent of GDP. “With the pandemic’s peak not yet in sight and the government not providing adequate direct fiscal support, the downside risks to our earlier forecast have materialised,” the agency said.

Single-digit contraction likely in July IIP: ICRA,"  Ratings agency ICRA expects a single-digit contraction in the upcoming print for the Index of Industrial Production for July 2020. According to the ratings agency, while the improvement in industry had gathered speed in July 2020, the momentum of the recovery in the services sector stalled that month. Other indicators, GST e-way bills, rail freight, port cargo traffic, domestic airlines’ passenger traffic, and the consumption of petrol and ATF, reported only a modest improvement in their YoY performance in July 2020, relative to June 2020. In contrast, the YoY performance of diesel consumption, hydroelectricity generation and refinery output had worsened in that month, with a continuing surge in infections causing the re-imposition of lockdowns in some states. As per the agency, Government expenditure, a key driver of economic activity in Q1FY21, reported a volatile trend in July 2020. It pointed out that revenue expenditure growth slipped from 40.1 per cent in June 2020 to 18.6 per cent in July 2020, while remaining substantial. However, capital expenditure contracted by 47.1 per cent in July 2020 after having more than doubled in June 2020. “The Indian economy is undoubtedly recovering from the lows seen in Q1 FY2021. However, the pace of the improvement in Q2FY21 is fragmented, with a sharper momentum in industry relative to services, amid a continuing healthy outlook for agriculture,” ICRA’s Principal Economist Aditi Nayar. “In our view, the contraction in GDP will narrow considerably to 11-13 per cent in Q2FY21, from 23.9 per cent in Q1 FY2021. While some indicators of the industrial sector displayed a sharp year-on-year (YoY) improvement in July 2020, relative to June 2020, especially automobile output and non-oil merchandise exports, the core sector displayed a muted recovery.” Besides, ICRA pointed out that available indicators for August 2020 have provided mixed cues, with a sharp improvement in coal and rail freight, juxtaposed with dips in electricity generation and diesel consumption.

"Silver Lake picks 1.75 pc stake in Reliance Retail for Rs 7,500 cr","  New Delhi, Sep 9 (PTI) US private equity firm Silver Lake Partners has picked up 1.75 per cent stake in the retail arm of Reliance Industries for Rs 7,500 crore, the Indian firm said in a statement. ""Reliance Industries Limited and Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) announced today that Silver Lake will invest Rs 7,500 crore into RRVL, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries,"" the statement said. This investment values RRVL at a pre-money equity value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore. Silver Lake's investment will translate into a 1.75 per cent equity stake in RRVL on a fully diluted basis. This marks the second billion-dollar investment by Silver Lake in a Reliance Industries subsidiary after the USD 1.35 billion investment in Jio Platforms announced earlier this year. ""Reliance Retail Limited, a subsidiary of RRVL, operates India's largest, fastest growing and most profitable retail business serving close to 640 million footfalls across its about 12,000 stores nationwide,"" the statement said. With more than USD 60 billion in combined assets under management and committed capital and a focus on the world's great tech and tech-enabled opportunities, Silver Lake is the global leader in large-scale technology investing. Its other investments have included Airbnb, Alibaba, Alphabet's Verily and Waymo units, Dell Technologies, Twitter and numerous other global technology leaders. After monetising Jio Platforms -- which houses the firm's telecom arm and digital ventures, richest Indian Mukesh Ambani is looking to rope in investors in the retail business. Reliance may be looking to sell about 10 per cent of Reliance Retail. Late last month, Reliance acquired the retail and logistics businesses of Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore to boost its retail vertical. Silver Lake was the first US private equity firm to invest in Jio after tech giant Facebook took a 9.99 per cent stake in the company for Rs 43,573.62 crore. Silver Lake bought 2.08 per cent in Jio in two tranches for a total of Rs 10,202.55 crore. Rival private equity groups KKR, Vista and General Atlantic followed Silver Lake to take stakes in Jio. Other notable investors included Google and Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. All investors in Jio Platforms including Silver Lake have been offered a chance to explore investing in Reliance Retail. Ambani had at Reliance Industries' recent annual general meeting stated that it had been approached by strategic/financial investors for a stake in Reliance Retail. Commenting on the transaction with Silver Lake, Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries, said, ""I am delighted to extend our relationship with Silver Lake to our transformational efforts of building an inclusive partnership with millions of small merchants while providing value to Indian consumers across the country in the Indian retail sector."" ""We believe technology will be key to bringing the much-needed transformation in this sector so that various constituents of the retail ecosystem can collaborate to build inclusive growth platforms. Silver Lake will be an invaluable partner in implementing our vision for Indian Retail,"" he said. Commenting on the investment, Egon Durban, Co-CEO and Managing Partner of Silver Lake, said, ""we are pleased to deepen our relationship with Reliance with this investment. Mukesh Ambani and his team at Reliance have created an outstanding world leader in retail and technology through their courageous vision, commitment to societal benefits, innovation excellence and relentless execution."" ""The success of JioMart in such a short time span, especially while India, along with the rest of the world, battles the COVID-19 pandemic, is truly unprecedented, and the most exciting growth phase has just begun. Reliance's new commerce strategy could become the disruptor of this decade. We are thrilled to have been invited to partner with Reliance in their mission for Indian Retail,"" Durban said. The transaction is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals. Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to Reliance Retail and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and Davis Polk & Wardwell acted as legal counsel. Latham & Watkins and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co acted as legal counsel for Silver Lake.  ",business
Entire GST dues will be paid: FinMin to States,"  The Centre has reached out to the states again clarifying that it would pay entire GST compensation dues to them amid the mounting opposition over the borrowing options proposed in lieu of the shortfall in indirect tax collections. Sources in the Finance Ministry said that the entire shortfall of compensation to the states -- irrespective of whether it is on account of the GST implementation or Covid pandemic -- will be compensated and the same has been communicated to the states again. “It has never been the stand of Union Finance Minister that the loss of revenue due to Covid would not be compensated. The Central government has, time and again, committed that the entitlement of the states would always be for full compensation. The entire compensation sum on account of shortfall in collections of Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be paid and honoured”, a top government source said. Under the two options given to the states towards settlement of the GST compensation, the first option provides option to borrow by states and under a special dispensation from the RBI for a sum of about Rs97,000 crore this year. This is the amount of shortfall calculated by the Centre that is directly on account of the GST implementation. The option two allows states to borrow from market the entire expected GST compensation shortfall of about Rs2,35,000 crore in FY21. States have been asked to return with their views on the options so that the scheme could be operationalised. Doubts arose over the option 1 with few states saying that GST compensation would be paid to states only for the shortfall arising due to the implementation of the new indirect tax regime and not the shortfall arising due Covid-19 disruptions. Finance Ministry sources said that working out the revenue shortfall on account of GST implementation is just a mechanism to assess how much of the shortfall should be met by borrowing and how much could be deferred. Borrowing for meeting the entire shortfall when the private sector is struggling to stand back on its feet could hurt them badly. “If states go for option 1 and borrow Rs 97,000 crore, it does not mean they will have to forego the remaining compensation. The remaining compensation will be paid to the states after the above borrowing has been fully repaid. Therefore, where is the doubt about the Centre not meeting its commitment?”, asked a top  ",business
Govt to sell 15-20% stake in IRCTC via OFS,"  The Government plans to sell about 15-20 per cent stake in IRCTC via offer for sale (OFS) and would like to complete the transaction in minimum number of tranches.   Last month, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) had invited bids from merchant bankers by September 10 for managing the sale in Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp (IRCTC).  However, it did not disclose the quantum of stake on offer in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Following this, a pre-bid meeting was held on September 4 with potential bidders.  DIPAM has now posted its response to the queries raised by potential bidders on its website. To a query on intended stake dilution percentage, DIPAM said, “The indicative percentage is 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The exact details will be shared with the selected merchant bankers.”  The government currently holds 87.40 per cent stake in IRCTC. To meet Sebi's public holding norm, it has to lower its stake in the company to 75 per cent. Shares of IRCTC on Tuesday closed 2.57 per cent lower at Rs 1,378.05 on the SE. Asked if payment would be made by the government to merchant banker after completion of every single tranche or cumulatively after the completion of entire transaction, DIPAM said, “GOI would not like to have an OFS overhang and hence would like to complete the transaction in minimum number of tranches as advised by merchant bankers based on market conditions.  “In case more than one tranche is used, pro-rata payment would be made to the merchant bankers”.  IRCTC, the only entity authorised by Indian Railways to provide catering services to railways, online railway tickets and packaged drinking water at railway stations and trains in India, was listed on stock exchanges in October 2019.

Fall in GDP alarming; time for bureaucracy to take meaningful action: Rajan,"  Terming the 23.9 per cent fall in economic growth in June quarter alarming, former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has said bureaucracy should come out of complacency and take meaningful action. The current crisis requires a more thoughtful and active government, he said, adding unfortunately, after an initial burst of activity, it seems to have retreated into a shell. ""The sharp decline in economic growth should alarm us all. The 23.9 per cent contraction in India (and the numbers will probably be worse when we get estimates of the damage in the informal sector) compares with a drop of 12.4 per cent in Italy and 9.5 per cent in the United States, two of the most COVID-19-affected advanced countries,""Rajan wrote in a post on his LinkedIn page. He further said the bureaucracy needs to be frightened out of their complacency and into meaningful activity. If there is a silver lining in the awful GDP numbers, hopefully it is that''. Rajan, currently a professor at the University of Chicago, said the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in India, so discretionary spending, especially on high-contact services like restaurants, and the associated employment, will stay low until the virus is contained. The eminent economist pointed out that the government's reluctance to do more today seems partly because it wants to conserve resources for a possible future stimulus. ""This strategy is self-defeating,"" he opined. Citing an example, Rajan said if one thinks of the economy as a patient, relief is the sustenance the patient needs while on the sickbed and fighting the disease. ""Without relief, households skip meals, pull their children out of school and send them to work or beg, pledge their gold to borrow, let EMIs and rent arrears pile up Essentially, the patient atrophies, so by the time the disease is contained, the patient has become a shell of herself,"" he noted. The former RBI Governor further said now think of economic stimulus as a tonic. ""When the disease is vanquished, it can help the patient get out of her sickbed faster. But if the patient has atrophied, stimulus will have little effect,"" he said. Rajan stressed that the recent pick-up in sectors like auto is not an evidence of the much awaited V-shaped recovery. ""It reflects pent-up demand, which will fade as we go down to the true level of demand in the damaged, partially-functioning, economy,"" he noted. Rajan pointed out that because of the pre-pandemic growth slowdown and the government's strained fiscal condition, officials believe it cannot spend on both relief and stimulus. ""This mindset is too pessimistic, but the government will have to expand the resource envelope in every way possible, and spend as cleverly as possible,"" he said adding it also has to take every action that can move the economy forward without additional spending. ""All this requires a more thoughtful and active government. Unfortunately, after an initial burst of activity, it seems to have retreated into a shell,"" the former RBI Governor added. Noting that India needs strong growth, not just to satisfy the aspirations of country's youth but to keep its unfriendly neighbours at bay, Rajan said temporary half-baked reforms , such as the recent suspension of labour protection laws in a number of states, will do little to enthuse industry or workers, and give reforms a bad name. He also suggested that reforms can be a form of stimulus, and even if not carried out immediately, a timeline to undertake them can boost current investor sentiment. ""The world will recover earlier than India, so exports can be a way for India to grow,"" he said. The government in May announced nearly Rs 21 lakh crore stimulus package to help the nation tide over the economic crisis induced by the coronavirus and subsequent lockdown. India's economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 23.9 per cent as the coronavirus-related lockdowns weighed on the already-declining consumer demand and investment. The GDP contraction in the world's fifth-largest economy is compared with 3.1 per cent growth in the preceding March quarter and 5.2 per cent expansion in the same period a year back. This is the sharpest contraction since quarterly figures started getting published in 1996 and worse than what was expected by most analysts. The Indian economy was in a troubled state when the pandemic hit the world. Before the crisis hit India, the economy was already decelerating, real GDP growth had moderated from 7 per cent in 2017-18 to 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 and 4.2 per cent in 2019-20.

PVR defers major capex plans amid Covid pandemic,"  As the coronavirus pandemic and the eventual lockdowns have brought the multiplex industry to a grinding halt, PVR has deferred a significant portion of its capital expenditure (capex) plans and it will reassess them once the shutdown is over and its operations resume. Nitin Sood, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of PVR has said that owing to the company’s cost control measures, its fixed costs for the future will be lower than it had before. Even after reopening, the company does not expect these to return to their previous levels soon. His message to the shareholders in PVR’s Annual Report said that the company is already in discussions with its developers for renegotiating the rental arrangements. Sood added that PVR’s other costs too will undergo reductions until some normalcy is restored. “We have also temporarily deferred a substantial portion of our planned capital expenditures that we were undertaking, prior to the shutdown. All major capital expenditures will now be re-assessed once the shutdown is over,” the CFO said. Throughout this crisis, according to him, the company has focused on business continuity and has undertaken measures to mitigate the risk. “Our strategy has been two pronged. First, we have brought down our fixed costs drastically during this period of lockdown, and second, we have raised debt to preserve liquidity on the balance sheet,” he said. Among the fixed costs, PVR has invoked the force majeure clause for rental payment and Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charges, under its contractual arrangements and has suspended rental payments, while it continues to be in discussions with mall developers. “In order to manage our liquidity during the period the cinemas are shut, the management has voluntarily taken a cut of 50 per cent in their compensation, while the rest of our employees have forsaken 20-50 per cent of their salaries. Owing to these actions, we have been successful in bringing a significant reduction in our monthly fixed costs,” Sood said. He was of the view in the post-covid era but the company will be in a stronger position.  ",business

More than Rs 10 lakh crore loans may avail restructuring benefit: Bankers,"  Banks may restructure loans of more than Rs 10 lakh crore largely attributed to 5-6 critical sectors, including aviation, commercial real estate and hospitality, that have been severely hit by the Covid-19 outbreak, according to bankers.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week asked banks and NBFCs to roll out one-time loan restructuring scheme for Covid-19 related stress by September 15.  According to a top official of a public sector bank, it is win-win for both lenders and borrowers.  Explaining the rationale, the banker said, corporates will try to save their business from turning non-performing asset (NPA) and buy crucial time for getting cash flow back for servicing the debt.  Secondly, banks have to make only 10 per cent provision against restructured account as compared to 15 per cent if the same account turns into NPA, the official said, adding that the lure of 5 per cent conservation of capital will also push banks for recast.  Given the benefit, the official said, it is estimated that 12-15 per cent of total loan book would avail one-time restructuring.  Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are already covered under the ongoing restructuring scheme which was tweaked recently to cover those impacted by COVID-19 crisis.  It is to be noted that a total Rs 100 lakh crore worth of loan is outstanding in the banking system.  Another banking official said that nearly half of the 30 per cent of the total loan book which sought moratorium, that ended on August 31, may avail restructuring.  Companies in about half-a-dozen vulnerable sectors -- hospitality, aviation, entertainment, commercial real estate and travel & tourism -- whose businesses have been impacted severely due to the COVID-19 crisis will make a beeline for the scheme.  KV Kamath committee report is expected to give financial parameters like hair cut, debt service coverage ratio, debt-equity ratio post-resolution and interest coverage ratio for recasting corporate loans for over half a dozen vulnerable sectors, the official added.  Last month, Punjab National Bank managing director S S Mallikarjuna Rao said about 5-6 per cent of loan book would go for restructuring as per RBI-approved guidelines.  “This 5-6 per cent comes to about Rs  40,000 crore. Major composition of this, of about 50 per cent, would be corporate books,” he had said.  ",business

India’s commitment to reform being taken seriously by foreign investors: FM,"  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said India’s commitment to reform is being taken seriously by foreign investors, which is evident from the good inflow of FDI even during the time of Covid-19. Between April-July, the Foreign Direct investment (FDI) into India stood at USD 20 billion.  “India’s commitment to reform is taken seriously by investors abroad and they take India to be a very desirable destination, otherwise we wouldn’t be seeing good amount of FDI coming even during the pandemic time when India, as many of our critics would say, had the strictest lockdown,” Sitharaman said.

The coal ministry has withdrawn five mines: Morga South Coal Mine, Fatehpur East, Madanpur (North), Morga-II, and Sayang Coal Mines from the list of mines that were proposed to be offered for commercial mining. It has, however added two mines: Dolesara, Jarekela and Jharpalam-Tangarghat (in Chhattisgarh). “Therefore, 38 coal mines are offered for auction for commercial mining under 11th Tranche of Auction under CM(SP) Act, 2015 and 1st Tranche of Auction under MMDR Act, 1957,” a statement from the coal ministry said. Though no reason has been provided for changes in the list of commercial coal mines, it is largely on technical grounds. As part of the initiative of opening up of the coal sector and allowing the private sector to commercially extract coal, the government launched the auction process for 41 coal mines on June 18, 2020.

Gadkari exhorts automakers to build flex-engine vehicles to promote alternative fuel,"  Promising all support to the automobile industry, Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday encouraged automakers to introduce flex-fuel engines in India on a large scale to promote alternative fuel in alignment with the Government’s ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ drive.  To encourage alternative fuel, the Government has decided to allow automakers meeting certain criteria to set up own fuel pumps, provided they sell green fuel too, Gadkari said, asserting that carmakers could easily introduce flex engines on par with Brazil, the US and Canada if they could leapfrog from BS-IV norms to BS-VI. “Government has taken a decision that the companies with a worth of more than Rs 250 crore can start their own petrol/diesels pumps but the condition is that they should have alternative fuel pumps also,” Road transport minister Gadkari said addressing SIAM’s 60th annual convention 2020 - ‘Rebuilding the Nation, Responsibly’ through video conference.

Thousands march in Berlin in support of refugees in Greece,"  Thousands of people marched in Berlin on Sunday demanding that the government do more to help migrants stuck in Greece, many of whom have been made homeless since fires ravaged the country’s largest refugee camp. The crowd marched through the capital to the landmark Victory Column carrying signs with slogans like “we have space” and “Seehofer, be a Christian” — a reference to Interior Minister Horst Seehofer. A little girl held a sign saying “let the people in” while a woman waved a placard saying “People are suffering, Fortress Europe looks on — and cuddles up to the right.” More than 12,000 migrants and refugees fled the fires, which the Greek government says were deliberately set by a small group of Afghan migrants to protest a virus lockdown at the Moria camp. Thousands have slept outdoors on a nearby roadside in the nights since the blazes. Germany’s government said last week it would take in 1,553 migrants — 408 families with children — from various Greek islands who already have been granted protected status in Greece. The move came on top of a decision to take in up to 150 unaccompanied children as part of a European effort. The weekend demonstrators demanded that Germany do more, and that the government not block independent state or municipal efforts to take in refugees themselves. About 3,000 people had registered to take part in the march, but police told the dpa news agency the crowd numbered in the “mid four-digit range.”  ",world

Iran says US ‘isolated’ as world powers dismiss sanctions,"  Iran said on Sunday its arch-foe the United States was “isolated” after a US unilateral declaration that UN sanctions are back in force against the Islamic republic was dismissed by other major powers. The Trump administration said the so-called “snapback” of the sanctions was in effect and threatened to “impose consequences” on any UN member state that fails to comply. “The United States is very, very isolated in its claims,” Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said. “The whole world is saying nothing has changed.” The sanctions in question were lifted in 2015 when Iran and six world powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the US -- reached a landmark nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. But US President Donald Trump withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, saying the deal — negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama — was insufficient. He also renewed and even strengthened Washington’s own sanctions. The US insists it is still a participant in the agreement that it walked out of, but only so it can activate the snapback option, which it announced on August 20. Virtually every other Security Council member disputes Washington’s ability to execute this legal pirouette, and the UN body has not taken the measure any further. On Sunday, two permanent council members — France and Britain — issued a joint statement along with non-permanent member Germany saying the US’s “purported notification” was “incapable of having any legal effect”. Russia also said the US lacked legal authority. “The illegitimate initiatives and actions of the United States by definition cannot have international legal consequences for other countries,” said its foreign ministry. Iran brushed off the move and called on the rest of the world to unite against what it called the US’s “reckless actions”.                  ",world
"$13,000 fine for breaking Covid rules in England","  People in England who refuse to self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus could face fines of up to 10,000 pounds ($13,000, 11,000 euros) under tough new regulations announced Saturday to tackle a surge in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that Britain was seeing a second wave of Covid-19, and introduced new restrictions for millions of people across northwest, northern and central England. In a further measure announced late Saturday, he said that from September 28 people will be legally obliged to self-isolate if they test positive or are told to by the National Health Service (NHS) tracing programme. “The best way we can fight this virus is by everyone following the rules and self-isolating if they’re at risk of passing on coronavirus,” Johnson said in a statement. “And so nobody underestimates just how important this is, new regulations will mean you are legally obliged to do so if you have the virus or have been asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace.” Currently people who have symptoms or test positive are asked to self-isolate for 10 days. Those who live with someone who either has symptoms or tests positive must self-isolate for 14 days. The new fines will start at 1,000 pounds — in line with breaking quarantine after international travel — and rise to 10,000 pounds for repeat offences and the worst breaches, including businesses that threaten self-isolating staff with redundancy, officials said. In an incentive to get people to comply, those on low incomes will be able to claim an extra lump sum of 500 pounds if they are unable to work from home during their isolation.       ",world
US judge approves injunction to delay WeChat restrictions,"  A federal judge has approved a request from a group of WeChat users to delay looming US government restrictions that could effectively make the popular app nearly impossible to use. In a ruling dated Saturday, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in California said the government’s actions would affect users’ First Amendment rights as an effective ban on the app removes their platform for communication. WeChat is a messaging-focused app popular with many Chinese-speaking Americans that serves as a lifeline to friends, family, customers and business contacts in China. It’s owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent. A group of WeChat users had made the request after the U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it would bar WeChat from U.S. App stores and keep it from accessing essential internet services in the country, beginning Sunday night at 11:59 p.M. The government cited national security and data-privacy concerns in taking action against WeChat and imposing similar restrictions on TikTok, another popular Chinese-owned app. The restrictions on TikTok were pushed back by a week Saturday after President Donald Trump said he supported a proposed deal that would make TikTok a U.S. Company. WeChat users had argued the moves targeting the all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools would restrict free speech. In the ruling, the court said that a WeChat ban “eliminates all meaningful access to communication in the plaintiffs’ community,” and that an injunction would be in public interest. The US government had earlier argued that it is not restricting free speech because WeChat users still “are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.” Specific evidence about WeChat posing a national security threat was also “modest,” according to Judge Beeler.

Afghan airstrikes kill 24 civilians: Witnesses,"  Government airstrikes in the north of Afghanistan killed 24 civilians, including children, and wounded six others, witnesses told The Associated Press on Sunday. The two witnesses contacted by the AP said that most of those killed in Saturday’s airstrikes, which struck the village of Sayed Ramazan in northern Kunduz province, were civilians. The Khanabad district in the province where the village is located is Taliban controlled. The Afghan Defence Ministry, however, said the airstrikes killed 30 Taliban fighters, but added an investigation was being held into claims that civilians were among those killed. The airstrikes come as Taliban and government-appointed negotiators are meeting for the first time in Qatar to discuss the future of Afghanistan and an end to decades of war and conflict. Villagers said an initial airstrike targeted a house belonging to a Taliban fighter, whose home doubled as a check post that stops and frisks people to ensure they are not connected to the government. The explosion set fire to a nearby home, trapping a family inside, said Latif Rahmani who witnessed the airstrikes. Speaking to the AP by phone, Rahmani said farmers and villagers ran to douse the fire and rescue trapped family members inside when a second airstrike hit, killing many of them. Rahmani, who said he was working on his house at the time of the airstrike, warned his neighbors against running toward the burning buildings for fear of a second airstrike. “I yelled at people and told them not to go because maybe there would be another bombing, but they ran to help and to put out the fire,” Rahmani said. A second witness in the area, Kalamuddin, who like many Afghans uses just one name, said the lone Taliban fighter living in the house that was initially hit had been killed. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid condemned the airstrikes and said the Taliban had no military operations in the area at the time of the airstrike. The United Nations has harshly criticised both sides in the conflict for the relentless killing of civilians in Afghanistan’s protracted war. The peace talks in Qatar are part of a US brokered deal with the Taliban that will eventually lead to US withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. In early July, Afghan national army personnel fired mortars into a busy market in southern Helmand, killing 23 people. The Defence Ministry is still investigating the incident. Also Saturday, at least six rockets were fired at NATO’s Resolute Support base in southern Kandahar. No casualties were reported and no one claimed responsibility. NATO said in a statement that if the Taliban were behind the rocket fire, it could jeopardise the US peace deal in which the Taliban have promised not to attack US and NATO forces.

Sikh girl missing in Pakistan’s Punjab province,"  A 22-year-old Sikh girl is missing in Pakistan’s Punjab province and police have launched a case against an “unknown abductor”, according to a media report on Sunday. The incident occurred recently in Attock district’s Hassanabdal city, which is home to the famous Gurdwara Panja Sahib — one of the most sacred sites in Sikhism. According to a report published in Dawn newspaper, the girl stepped out of her house to throw away trash, but never returned. Her father runs a shop in Hassanabdal. The report, however, did not mention the date of the incident. A case had been registered by Hassanabdal police against an “unknown abductor” on the complaint of the girl’s father under Section 365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code for kidnapping, abducting or inducing a woman to marry, the report said, quoting Raja Fayyaz-ul-Hassan, the sub-divisional police officer. Police have launched a hunt for the missing girl, the officer said. Sub-Inspector Tahir Iqbal, the spokesman for district police, also said that a case was registered against an “unknown abductor” immediately after the girl’s father filed a complaint. The day after she went missing she reportedly sent a WhatsApp message to her father telling him that she had contracted a marriage of her own will and converted to Islam, said sub-divisional police officer Hassan. He said several police teams were looking for the girl so that she could be produced before a court of law and her statement recorded.  ",world
Iran vows ‘hit’ on all involved in US killing of top general,"  The chief of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard threatened on Saturday to go after everyone who had a role in a top general’s January killing during a US drone strike in Iraq. The guard’s website quoted Gen. Hossein Salami as saying, “Mr. Trump! Our revenge for martyrdom of our great general is obvious, serious and real.” US President Donald Trump warned this week that Washington would harshly respond to any Iranian attempts to take revenge for the death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, tweeting that “if they hit us in any way, any form, written instructions already done we’re going to hit them 1000 times harder.” The president’s warning came in response to a report that Iran was plotting to assassinate the US ambassador to South Africa in retaliation for Soleimani’s killing at Baghdad’s airport at the beginning of the year. “We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many, many troops and many people all over the world,” Trump said. “Qasem Soleimani is dead. He’s dead. Bad guy. Bad guy. Very bad guy.”  Salami rejected the report of an Iranian plot to assassinate Ambassador Lana Marks, but made clear that Iran intends to avenge the general’s death. “Do you think we hit a female ambassador in return to our martyred brother?’ the general said. “We will hit those who had direct and indirect roles. You should know that everybody who had role in the event will be hit, and this is a serious message. We do prove everything in practice.” In January, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting US soldiers in Iraq in response to the fatal drone strike. Trump has stepped up economic pressure on Iran with sanctions since he pulled the United States out of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Tehran has continued to expand its stockpile of enriched uranium and pressured other nations to offset the harm of US sanctions, while insisting it does not want to develop a nuclear weapon.

TikTok files lawsuit against Trump admin to fight US ban,"  TikTok asked a federal judge in Washington to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the fast-growing social-media network. TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance Ltd., filed a complaint late Friday night challenging the Trump administration’s recent moves to prevent the app from operating in the U.S. The lawsuit marks the second time TikTok has challenged President Donald Trump’s actions in court, bringing a high-stakes geopolitical fight over technology and trade into the U.S. legal system. Trump exceeded his authority, the company said, and did so for political reasons rather than to stop an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the U.S., as the law requires. TikTok also said the ban violates its First Amendment free-speech rights. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump’s actions would “destroy an online community where millions of Americans have come together to express themselves,” according to the complaint. The company claimed that the U.S. government has “ignored evidence” showing TikTok’s commitment to the privacy and security of its American users. On August 6, Trump issued an executive order saying he would ban transactions with the app within 45 days, arguing that the social network’s Chinese ownership made it a national security threat. TikTok sued to block that order in federal court in Californa in August. But on Friday, the Commerce Dept, moving to implement Trump’s order, said TikTok would be banned in the U.S. starting on Nov. 12 unless it could complete a takeover deal that assuages the government’s concerns. Trump’s order followed an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews proposed acquisitions of domestic businesses by overseas investors for national security concerns. And it set off a flurry of attempted deal-making, pushing ByteDance to seek a sale of TikTok’s American operations to a U.S. company. TikTok is currently in talks with Oracle Corp. about a possible deal.               ",world
China sends more warplanes on day 2,"  China sent more warplanes toward Taiwan for the second day on Saturday as the island’s leader, senior Government officials and a high-level US envoy paid tribute to the man who led Taiwan’s transition to democracy, former President Lee Teng-hui. Keith Krach, the US undersecretary for state, kept a low profile at the service. His presence at the event and on the island has drawn a strong rebuke from China, which sent 18 warplanes across the midline of the Taiwan Strait Friday in an unusually large display of force. On Saturday, Beijing dispatched 19 more warplanes, two of which were bombers, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. The island’s air force scrambled their own and deployed an air defense missile system to monitor China’s activities, according to a statement. The service was held at the Aletheia University in Taipei on a balmy Saturday morning, with President Tsai Ing-wen honouring Lee for bringing a peaceful political transition to the island democracy. Lee had built a separate Taiwanese political identity, distinct from mainland China, which claims Taiwan as part of its own territory to be reunited by force if necessary. Lee’s carving out of a non-Chinese identity and insistence that the island be treated as an equal country brought him into direct conflict with Beijing. He died on July 30 at age 97. “We have a responsibility to continue his endeavours, allowing the will of the people to reshape Taiwan, further defining Taiwan’s identity and deepening and bolstering democracy and freedom,” Tsai said. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the Dalai Lama also paid tribute from afar. “We Buddhists believe in life after life, so most probably he will be reborn in Taiwan,” the Dalai Lama said in a video message. “His rebirth will carry his spirit continuously.” The guests included another former Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori. They wore masks and sat spaced out in pews. Lee, an agricultural economist and politician, devoted his career toward building democracy on the island through direct elections and other changes. He was the first government official to speak out and formally apologise for the so-called 228 incident, named after February 28, 1947, when soldiers under the Kuomingtang, or the sole ruling Nationalist Party, shot and killed thousands of civilians in an anti-government uprising. The bloodshed marked the beginning of a decades-long period known as the White Terror in which the island was ruled by martial law.  ",world
UNSC welcomes start of Afghan Peace Negotiations; encourages parties to engage in good faith,"  The UN Security Council on Friday welcomed the start of the Afghanistan Peace Negotiations in Doha and strongly encouraged the parties to continue pursuing confidence-building measures, including reduction in violence and to continue to engage in good faith. In a statement, the 15-member powerful organ of the world body reaffirmed its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of war-torn Afghanistan. “The members of the Security Council recognised that a sustainable peace can be achieved only through a comprehensive and inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process that aims at a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire as well as an inclusive political settlement to end the conflict in Afghanistan,” it said. They “strongly encouraged parties to the negotiations to continue pursuing confidence-building measures including reductions in violence and to continue to engage in good faith.” The Council reaffirmed the importance of the UN’s role in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan and welcomed the efforts of all regional and international partners of Afghanistan in facilitating intra-Afghan negotiations and in helping the parties reach peace. The Security Council members also thanked the government of Qatar for facilitating the first round of negotiations. The first-ever direct talks between the Afghan government representatives and the Taliban began on September 12. Negotiators from the Afghan government and the Taliban will hold talks as part of intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha to bring a lasting peace to Afghanistan.  ",world
US court turns down challenge to Trump’s temporary ban on H-1B,"  An Indian-American federal judge has turned down an appeal by 169 Indian citizens who had challenged President Donald Trump’s order that barred foreign nationals on H-1B specialty occupation visas from entering the US till the end of the year. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. US District Judge Amit P Mehta of US District Court for the District of Columbia in his 11-page order on Wednesday said that Indian citizens, who are now trapped abroad during trips to India when borders closed, are unlikely to win their case contesting the travel ban proclamation of Trump.

China biopharma plant leak infects thousands with bacterial disease,"  Thousands of people in northwest China have tested positive for a bacterial disease after a leak from a state-owned biopharmaceutical plant making animal vaccines last year. Health officials in Lanzhou city said 3,245 people had contracted brucellosis, a disease often caused by close contact with infected animals or animal products that can bring about fevers, joint pain and headaches. Another 1,401 people tested as an early positive for the disease, and health authorities said there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission so far. Chinese authorities found a biopharmaceutical plant had used expired disinfectant in its production of Brucella vaccines for animals between July and August last year — meaning the bacteria was not eradicated in its factory exhaust.

Same-sex couples in HK get legal victory over inheritance law,"  Hong Kong’s high court on Friday ruled that same-sex couples should receive equal treatment under inheritance law, in a step forward for LGBT rights in the finance hub. But the victory came on the same day as a separate legal bid for full recognition of foreign same-sex marriages was struck down, underscoring what campaigners say is a lack of progress on equality issues. Hong Kong’s law does not allow same-sex marriage and does not recognise foreign unions, though limited recognition has been granted in recent years in several landmark rulings. Edgar Ng, a gay Hong Konger, last year launched a legal challenge against the city’s inheritance and intestacy laws, alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2018 he bought a government-subsidised flat, a year after marrying his partner in London, according to court documents. Under Hong Kong’s housing policy, his husband cannot be recognised as the joint homeowner, and Ng was concerned that should he die without a will, his property would not be passed to his partner. In the judgement handed down Friday, Judge Anderson Chow said the exclusion of spouses in same-sex marriages from their legal entitlements “constitutes unlawful discrimination”. The judge said “differential treatment is not justified”. LGBT rights activists with campaign group Hong Kong Marriage Equality described the ruling as an “important victory”. “The government should seize this opportunity to work with the LGBT+ community to implement marriage equality in the city,” the association said.

Belarus activists make list of police from protest crackdown,"  The main opposition candidate in Belarus’ disputed presidential election said Thursday that activists are compiling a list of law enforcement officers who were allegedly involved in violence against protesters denouncing the results of the vote. Nearly 7,000 people were detained and hundreds were brutally beaten by police during the first several days of post-election protests in Belarus that are now in their sixth week. Opposition supporters claim the Aug. 9 vote was rigged to reelect President Alexander Lukashenko to a sixth term and are demanding his resignation. Lukashenko’s main challenger in the election, former English teacher and political novice Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said on Thursday that the opposition was drawing up a list of individual officers involved in the police crackdown. “We have been given the names of those who were beating and torturing people,” she said in a statement. “We are preparing a list of officials and law enforcement officers who have taken part in lawless repressions.” Human rights groups are working with opposition activists to identify the officers and officials, Tsikhanouskaya said, adding that the list will be shared with the United States, the European Union and Russia. Tsikhanouskaya, who left for Lithuania in the wake of the election under pressure from Belarusian authorities, said the opposition will name the list in honor of Alexander Taraikovsky, a protester who died in Minsk the day after the election as police dispersed peaceful demonstrators. Authorities initially said an explosive device Taraikovsky intended to throw at police blew up in his hands and killed him.                  ",world
Poland’s president appoints daughter as unpaid advisor,"  Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has appointed his 25-year-old daughter, Kinga, to be an unpaid adviser on social issues. The president stressed on Twitter late Wednesday that his daughter was working as a volunteer and “does not receive any remuneration.”he appointment nonetheless raised some allegations of nepotism by critics of Duda and the ruling right-wing party that backs him, Law and Justice. Kinga Duda, a lawyer, has already been dubbed by presidential critics as “Poland’s Ivanka Trump,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s daughter, who plays a key role in the U.S. Administration. Kinga Duda has for the most part not played a visible role in the presidency of her father, who won his first five-year term in 2015 and was re-elected in July. However she seized the nation’s attention with an election night speech in July in which she called for all people in society to be respected despite their differences. It was seen as an attempt to soften her father’s image.  ",world
Former model accuses Trump of sexually assaulting her in 1997,"  A former model has accused US President Donald Trump of groping and forcibly kissing her in 1997 — the latest allegation made against the Republican incumbent just weeks before he seeks reelection. Amy Dorris told Britain’s The Guardian that Trump sexually assaulted her in his VIP suite at the US Open tennis tournament in New York — claims he denied via his lawyers. “He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him off. And then that’s when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything,” Ms Dorris said in an interview. “I was in his grip, and I couldn’t get out of it,” she added. Trump has faced more than a dozen allegations of sexual misconduct, including a claim by prominent American columnist E. Jean Carroll that he raped her in a department store changing room in the mid-1990s. But he brushed them aside in his run for the White House. Shortly before the 2016 election, a tape recording emerged from 2005 in which he was heard boasting about how his fame allowed him to “grab” women by the genitals when he wanted. Trump dismissed this as “locker room banter” but subsequently apologised.        ",world

Outgoing US ambassador to China to help Republican campaigns,"  Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said he will help out Republicans campaigning in his native Iowa after returning home next month. Branstad also told Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV that he considered the phase one trade deal between China and the U.S. As the biggest achievement of his three years in China. Branstad, 73, said he would be working on behalf of President Donald Trump, Senator Joni Ernst and others, but not in any official role. “My son is very involved in (Trump’s) campaign, and I will be a volunteer to help him, to help Joni Ernst and other friends for the election in Iowa. But I will strictly be a volunteer,” Branstad told the station in a report broadcast Thursday. Ernst, the state’s junior senator, is locked in a tight race, with Democrats hoping to capture her seat on the way to flipping the Senate. As Iowa’s governor, Branstad was an early Trump supporter and has served as his top envoy to China during the most tempestuous period in relations since diplomatic ties were established in 1979. Branstad was governor of the major farming state for 22 years over two spans, from 1983 to 1999 and 2011 to 2017. Early in his first term, he met Xi Jinping, now China’s leader, when the then county-level Communist Party official visited Iowa on a 1985 trade trip. The phase one trade deal reached between the U.S. And China in January amid the ongoing tariff war between the sides represented a truce but did not address the more fundamental complaints of the American side. Still, Branstad said he believed it was ultimately in the best interests of both sides to follow-through with it. “This was a long and difficult process,” Branstad said. “They worked long and hard to reach an agreement that I think is fair and reciprocal. And it’s going to make a difference for both of our countries.” Branstad will leave at time when tensions between the sides are also running high over Taiwan, the South China Sea, the coronavirus pandemic and allegations of spying and technology theft. In July, the U.S. Ordered the closure of China’s consulate in Houston, calling it a “center of malign activity.” China retaliated by ordering the shuttering of the U.S. Consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.

Poison was on water bottle in Navalny’s hotel room: His team,"  The nerve agent used to poison Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was detected on an empty water bottle from his hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk, suggesting he was poisoned there and not at the airport as previously thought, his team said on Thursday. Navalny fell violently ill on a domestic flight in Russia last month and was subsequently airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Germany says he was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent. Russia says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned. A video posted on Navalny’s Instagram account showed members of his team searching the room he had just left in the Xander Hotel in Tomsk on Aug. 20, an hour after they learned he had fallen sick in suspicious circumstances. “It was decided to gather up everything that could even hypothetically be useful and hand it to the doctors in Germany. The fact that the case would not be investigated in Russia was quite obvious,” the post said. It showed his team bagging several empty bottles of “Holy Spring” mineral water, among other items, while wearing protective gloves. “Two weeks later, a German laboratory found traces of Novichok precisely on the bottle of water from the Tomsk hotel room,” the post said. “And then more laboratories that took analyses from Alexei confirmed that that was what poisoned Navalny. Now we understand: it was done before he left his hotel room to go to the airport.” Russia has carried out pre-investigation checks, but said it needs to see more medical analysis before it can open a formal criminal investigation into the case.

US envoy begins second high-level visit to Taiwan,"  US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach arrived in Taiwan on Thursday for the second visit by a high-level American official in two months, prompting a stern warning and threat of possible retaliation from China. Beijing considers Taiwan its own and opposes all official contacts between other countries and the self-governing island. Krach arrived at an air force base in Taipei, the capital, for a three-day visit. Wearing a face mask, he bumped elbows in greetings with Taiwanese Deputy Foreign Minister Harry Ho-Jen Tseng. Krach, the highest-level State Department official to visit the island in decades, is to meet Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and other senior officials, the island’s foreign ministry said. The visit by Krach, who is undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, follows a high-profile trip in August by U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar, the highest-level U.S. Cabinet official to visit since the U.S. Switched formal relations from Taiwan to China in 1979. However, the U.S. Has maintained unofficial ties with Taiwan since the official diplomatic break and is the island’s most important ally and provider of defense equipment. Ahead of Krach’s arrival, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, had lunch Wednesday with Taiwan’s top official in New York, a meeting she called historic and a further step in the Trump administration’s campaign to strengthen relations with Taiwan. Craft said her lunch with James K.J. Lee, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York, was the first meeting between a top Taiwan official and a U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations since 1971, when the China seat at the U.N. Was passed from Taipei to Beijing. “I’m looking to do the right thing by my president, and I feel that he has sought to strengthen and deepen this bilateral relationship with Taiwan and I want to continue that on behalf of the administration,” she told The Associated Press. In Taiwan, Krach is to attend a banquet hosted by Tsai on Friday and hold discussions on the creation of a new economic and commercial dialogue, according to Taiwan’s de facto ambassador in the U.S., Hsiao Bi-khim. He will also attend a memorial service for former President Lee Teng-hui, who led the island’s transition to democracy and died at age 97 in July. Krach’s visit and Craft’s lunch with Lee are certain to exacerbate mounting tensions between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Hong Kong and the South China Sea. China condemned the visit on Thursday and warned it could retaliate. At a daily briefing Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Krach’s visit violates U.S. Commitments to China and “bolsters the separatist forces of Taiwan independence and undermines China-U.S. Relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” adding that Beijing had “lodged solemn complaints” with Washington over the matter. “We urge the U.S. To fully recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue ... Immediately stop official exchanges and actions of improving substantive relations with Taiwan, and handle Taiwan-related issues cautiously,” Wang said. “China will make necessary responses in accordance with the development of the situation.”            ",world

"Navalny posts hospital photo of himself, plans Russia return","  Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny posted a picture of himself from his hospital bed in Germany on Tuesday, looking gaunt but joking wryly about his condition and saying that he was enjoying the ability to finally breathe on his own after being poisoned with a nerve agent. The Instagram post was the first image of the 44-year-old released since he was taken to Berlin’s Charite hospital two days after falling ill on a domestic flight in Russia on Aug. 20. “Hi, this is Navalny,” he wrote in the Russian-language post. “I have been missing you. I still can’t do almost anything on my own, but yesterday I managed to breathe on my own for the entire day.” Navalny had been kept in an induced coma for more than two weeks as he was treated with an antidote before hospital officials said on Sept. 7 that his condition had improved enough for him to be brought out of it. On Monday, the hospital said he had been removed from mechanical ventilation and was able to leave his bed for “short periods of time.” In the photo, Navalny is being given a hug by his wife Yulia and is flanked by his two children as he sits upright in his bed in a hospital gown. His statement even had the ring of his well-known sarcastic humor. “Just on my own, no extra help, I didn’t even use the simplest valve in my throat,” he said of being able to breathe without ventilation. “I liked it very much. It’s a remarkable process that is underestimated by many. Strongly recommended.” Despite his recovery, doctors have said they cannot rule out long-term health issues associated with the poisoning. Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, tweeted that once he had recovered, Navalny plans to return to Russia. “No other option has ever been considered,” she wrote. Leonid Volkov, a top associate of Navalny, refused to give any details on his condition or his possible return when reached by The Associated Press on Tuesday.       ",world
Iran warns US against strategic mistake after Trump threat,"  Iran warned the US on Tuesday against making a “strategic mistake” after President Donald Trump threatened Tehran over reports it planned to avenge the killing of top general Qasem Soleimani. “We hope that they do not make a new strategic mistake and certainly in the case of any strategic mistake, they will witness Iran’s decisive response,” government spokesman Ali Rabiei told a televised news conference. A US media report, quoting unnamed officials, said that an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the US ambassador to South Africa was planned before the US presidential election in November. “Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday. Rabiei expressed regret that “the president of a country who has claims to global management and order would make hasty, agenda-fuelled and dubious remarks on such a weak basis.” He warned that reacting to such reports would “achieve nothing but disruption to the region and to world calm” and advised Trump to “refrain from fresh adventurism... for the sake of winning a new term as president.” On Monday, the foreign ministry denied the report of an assassination plot as “baseless” and part of “repetitive and rotten methods to create an anti-Iranian atmosphere”.

"Trump: Retaliation will be 1,000 times greater","  President Donald Trump has warned Iran that any attack against the US would be retaliated with “1,000 times greater in magnitude” after media reports that Tehran is planning to avenge the killing of top general Qasem Soleimani in January. The death of Gen Soleimani, head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in a US airstrike near Baghdad’s airport marks a major escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran, since US President Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed crippling sanctions. Iran had vowed to seek revenge for Gen Soleimani’s killing. “Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!” Trump said in a tweet after news reports emerged that Iran is planning some kind of attack against the US. “Iran may be planning an assassination or other attack, against the US in retaliation for the killing of terrorist leader Soleimani, which was carried out for his planning a future attack, murdering US Troops, and the death & suffering caused over so many years,” Trump wrote. In a news report based on unnamed intelligence sources, the Politico said “the Iranian government is weighing an assassination attempt against the American ambassador to South Africa Lana Marks. “If carried out, it could dramatically ratchet up already serious tensions between the US and Iran and create enormous pressure on Trump to strike back — possibly in the middle of a tense election season,” the American news outlet said. An intelligence source told Fox News that the intel community is taking the threat against the ambassador seriously and believe the Iranian regime potentially has the ability to act on an assassination plot. Iran has in the past planned assassinations of American ambassadors -- which is partly why the intelligence community is taking this particular threat assessment seriously, the news channel said. Iran has denied the allegations. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement that the assassination allegations were part of ongoing anti-Iranian propaganda by the Americans ahead of the elections scheduled for November 3.

US lawyer says Assange faces decades in prison if convicted,"  An American lawyer told an extradition hearing in Britain for Julian Assange on Monday that the WikiLeaks founder faces decades in prison if he is convicted on spying charges in the United States. US prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 17 espionage charges, and one of computer misuse, over WikiLeaks’ publication of secret US Military documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.

Iraq’s top Shiite cleric backs early parliamentary elections,"  Iraq’s top Shiite cleric on Sunday threw his support behind the prime minister’s announcement to hold parliamentary elections ahead of schedule next year, saying the timing should not serve the interests of political groups.

A photo released by al-Sistani’s office showed the black-turbaned cleric meeting with the UN envoy and an interpreter. Sunday’s meeting was the first public face-to-face between al-Sistani and a foreign official since the spread of coronavirus in Iraq earlier this year. The country is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the region, with nearly 300,000 confirmed cases and more than 7,900 deaths. It is also the first such meeting since al-Sistani, 90, underwent surgery for a fractured bone in January. In August, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi said parliamentary elections would be held in June, nearly a year before they had been scheduled to take place. Early elections have been a key demand of protesters, who have been holding mass demonstrations since October demanding change in the country where corruption is widespread. A new government will be formed by the politician who secures the most support from parliamentary blocs after the elections. “Parliamentary elections scheduled for next year are very important,” the Iran-born al-Sistani, who enjoys wide influence in Iraq and among Shiite Muslims worldwide, said.

Mali Opposition opposes junta proposal on transition period,"  Divisions deepened between Mali’s military coup leaders and the country’s political opposition movement on Sunday after the ruling junta announced a plan that would allow a military leader to oversee an 18-month transitional period. While the two sides initially were united in wanting the departure of former President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, their paths have increasingly diverged since he was deposed in an August 18 coup after months of street demonstrations by the opposition. On Sunday, the opposition coalition known as M5-RFP publicly objected to the junta’s plan, which was announced Saturday after three days of talks on Mali’s political future. “The final document read at the closing ceremony was not consistent with the deliberations of the various groups, including the majority choice of a transition led by a civilian,” the M5-RFP statement said. The junta proposed that the transition be led by either a military or civilian leader, which leaves open the possibility that the military officers who seized power could remain at the helm for another 18 months until elections are organised. The 15-nation West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS has warned that by Tuesday the junta must designate a civilian leader to head a one-year transition period or else the country could face further sanctions. ECOWAS has already stopped financial transfers into the country and has closed its borders with Mali.  ",world
Greece welcomes Turkish survey ship’s return to Med Sea port,"  The Greek Government welcomed a Turkish survey vessel’s return to port Sunday from a disputed area of the eastern Mediterranean that has been at the heart of a summer stand-off between Greece and Turkey over energy rights. The Oruc Reis research ship returned to near the southern Turkish port of Antalya for the first time in weeks after Turkey announced in July that it was dispatching a vessel to work in waters that Greece claims are its exclusive jurisdiction. “This is a positive signal. We will see how this develops to make a proper assessment,? Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas told TV channel Skai.  ",world
UK ex-PMs call for boycott of Johnson’s Brexit bill plan,"  Britain’s former prime ministers from rival parties, Tony Blair and John Major, united on Sunday to call on members of Parliament to boycott Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposed law aimed at overriding parts of the Brexit divorce agreement. Ahead of the Internal Market Bill coming up for debate in the House of Commons on Monday, Major as a member of Johnson’s own Conservative Party and Blair from the Opposition Labour Party warned that what is being proposed by the prime minister is “shocking” and has wide-ranging ramifications on all future trade negotiations, not only with the European Union (EU) but with other nations. “The overt repudiation of the treaty — by seeking to override unilaterally the provisions agreeing to the application of certain EU rules to Northern Ireland — strikes at the very heart of the withdrawal agreement,” the duo wrote in a joint article for ‘The Sunday Times’. “If the government has concerns about specific parts of the withdrawal treaty, there are ready mechanisms within it to resolve them amicably; in the first instance by negotiation between the UK and the EU and, if that fails, through independent arbitration. It has chosen to ignore these options. Instead, it has thrown the withdrawal treaty into uncertainty and given the EU genuine reason to question whether Britain can be relied upon in any future trade agreements with the EU,” they wrote. Major was a Conservative prime minister from 1990 to 1997. His Labour successor Blair served as Britain’s PM from 1997 to 2007. Amid growing discord over the issue within his own party, Boris has sought the backing of his MPs for the new Bill saying the EU is threatening to impose a customs border in the Irish Sea, separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The Bill focuses on the Northern Ireland Protocol – the part of the Brexit divorce designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. If it became law, it would give UK ministers powers to modify or “disapply” rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from January 2021, unless the UK and EU are able to strike a trade deal ahead of that.

Belarus police detain 250 protesters in Minsk as crowds swell,"  Belarus police detained at least 250 protesters as tens of thousands demonstrated in the capital Minsk in advance of talks between strongman Alexander Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Security forces dressed in riot gear used barbed wire to seal off the central square in the capital. “Some 250 people were detained in various districts of the capital,” the interior ministry said in a statement, adding those arrested were carrying flags and “offensive” placards. Oktyabrskaya Square in central Minsk was fenced off with barbed wire with armed law enforcement forces seen behind it.                  ",world
Bloomberg to spend at least $100m to help Biden in Florida,"  Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is committing at least $100 million to help Joe Biden’s presidential campaign in the crucial battleground state of Florida. Bloomberg’s late stage infusion of cash reflects Democrats’ concerns about the tight race in a state that is a priority for President Donald Trump. A victory for Joe Biden in Florida, the largest of the perennial battleground states, would significantly complicate Trump’s path to reaching the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure a second term.

Whistleblower’s claims on Russian interference fits pattern,"  A whistleblower’s allegation that he was pressured to suppress intelligence about Russian election interference is the latest in a series of similar accounts involving former Trump administration officials, raising concerns the White House risks undercutting efforts to stop such intrusions if it plays down the seriousness of the problem. There is no question the administration has taken actions to counter Russian interference, including sanctions and criminal charges on Thursday designed to call out foreign influence campaigns aimed at American voters. But Trump’s resistance to embracing the gravity of the threat could leave the administration without a consistent and powerful voice of deterrence at the top of the government heading into an election that US Officials say is again being targeted by Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin “is not deterred,” said Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee. Himes said Putin feels “empowered, probably inoculated in the U.S. Because of the president’s behaviour.” Brian Murphy, the former top intelligence official at the Department of Homeland Security, alleges in the complaint made public Wednesday that he was instructed to hold back on reports on Russian interference because they “made the president look bad.” That follows previous reports that Trump berated his then-intelligence director after a congressional briefing about Moscow’s interference and that the president sought the firing of another official who told Congress he supported intelligence agencies’ assessment that Russia had interfered on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 election. The department denied Murphy’s allegation, and the White House issued a statement describing instances in which it said the president had it taken action against Russia. “This president has been resolute that any foreign adversary seeking to disrupt our elections will face tremendous consequences,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said. Senior Trump administration officials have been eager to focus more on China in discussing election interference, asserting that Beijing is the more potent danger. Though intelligence officials do say China is a major espionage concern, there is also bipartisan consensus, including in a Republican-led Senate report, that Russia directly interfered in 2016 with the goal of helping Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. This year, intelligence officials say, Russia is working to denigrate Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Murphy is not alone in alleging that he felt stymied from raising the Russia threat head-on. Miles Taylor, as chief of staff to former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, participated in high-level administration meetings and has in recent weeks publicly conveyed his concerns about Trump’s leadership. Taylor said Nielsen had to create a “shadow” National Security Council to deal with the issue because she felt the president’s own team had not convened enough meetings to coordinate a response.

Erdogan slams Macron amid east Mediterranean tensions,"  Turkey’s president has taken aim at France’s leader, following French criticism about Turkish maritime activities in the eastern Mediterranean that have ignited tensions with Greece and the European Union. In a speech Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron was targeting him. “You will have many more problems with me,” Erdogan said, adding, “don’t mess with the Turkish nation and Turkey.” On Friday, Marcon said that Europe needed to be “clear and firm” with Erdogan’s government over its actions. France and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds over an arms embargo for Libya and over the situation in the eastern Mediterranean, where Paris is supporting Greece and Cyprus, who say Turkey is looking for oil and gas in their waters. Turkey says it has equal rights to the resources in those waters. Erdogan also said France has no right to criticise Turkey, considering its colonial record.    ",world
Greek refugee camp fire: Thousands still homeless,"  Thousands of asylum-seekers have spent a fourth night sleeping in the open on the Greek island of Lesbos, after successive fires destroyed a notoriously overcrowded migrant and refugee camp during a coronavirus lockdown. Officials have said the Tuesday and Wednesday night blazes were deliberately set by some camp residents angered at quarantine and isolation orders imposed after 35 people in the Moria camp tested positive for COVID-19. With the camp gutted, Saturday morning found men, women and children sleeping under improvised shelters made of reed stalks, blankets and salvaged tents. Thousands gathered for a protest to demand to be allowed to leave the island. Mostly children and women stood at the front of crowed as the protest got underway peacefully as riot police observed. Participants held up banners with slogans written on pieces of cardboard or sheets. “We need peace & freedom. Moria kills all lives,” read one. Leaving the island would require a bending of European Union rules, under which asylum-seekers reaching Greece’s islands from Turkey must stay there until they are either granted refugee status or deported back to Turkey. The Moria camp was built to house around 2,750 people but was so overcrowded that this week’s fires left more than 12,000 in need of emergency shelter on Lesbos. The camp had long been held up by critics as a symbol of Europe’s failings in migration policy.           ",world
Expect US polls to have consequences for troops overseas,"  President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden both say they want to pull US forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan. But their approaches differ, and the outcome of the November 3 election will have long-term consequences not only for US troops, but for the wider region. During his election campaign four years ago, Trump pledged to bring all troops home from “endless wars,” at times triggering pushback from military commanders, defense leaders and even Republican lawmakers worried about abruptly abandoning partners on the ground. In recent months he has only increased the pressure, working to fulfill that promise and get forces home before Election Day. More broadly, Trump’s ‘America First’ mantra has buoyed voters weary of war and frustrated with the billions of dollars spent on national defense at the expense of domestic needs. But it has also alienated longtime European partners whose forces have fought alongside the United States, and has bruised America’s reputation as a loyal ally. Biden has been more adamant about restoring US relations with allies and NATO, and his stance on these wars is more measured. He says troops must be withdrawn responsibly and that a residual force presence will be needed in Afghanistan to ensure terrorist groups can’t rebuild and attack America again. That approach, however, angers progressives and others who believe the US has spent too much time, money and blood on battlefields far from home. “We’re getting out of the endless wars,” Trump told White House reporters recently. He said the “top people in the Pentagon” probably don’t love him because “they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.” He continued: “Let’s bring our soldiers back home. Some people don’t like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money.” Biden, the former vice president, has sounded less absolute about troop withdrawal. In response to a candidate questionnaire from the Center for Foreign Relations, he said some troops could stay in Afghanistan to focus on the counterterrorism mission. “Americans are rightly weary of our longest war; I am, too. But we must end the war responsibly, in a manner that ensures we both guard against threats to our homeland and never have to go back,” he said.  ",world
Warring Afghans meet to find peace,"  Afghanistan’s warring sides started negotiations on Saturday for the first time aimed at ending decades of war, bringing together delegates appointed by the Afghan government and the Taliban. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the opening ceremony, which was held in Qatar where the meetings will take place. It’s the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity by the Trump administration ahead of the US presidential election in November. The discussions are important in the search for lasting peace that will also provide an exit for US and NATO troops after nearly 19 years. The sides will try to tackle tough issues. This includes the terms of a permanent cease-fire, the rights of women and minorities and the disarming of tens of thousands of Taliban fighters and militias loyal to warlords, some of them aligned with the government. The talks in Doha follow the US-brokered recognition of Israel by two Gulf nations — Bahrain on Friday and the United Arab Emirates earlier this month. The Afghan sides are also expected to discuss constitutional changes, and power sharing. Even seemingly mundane issues like the flag and the name of the country — the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan or as the Taliban’s administration had been known, when it ruled, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan — could find their way on to the negotiation table and roil tempers. Among the government-appointed negotiators are four women, who vow to preserve women’s rights in any power-sharing deal with the fundamentalist Taliban. This includes the right to work, education and participation in political life -- all denied women when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan for five years. The Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a US-led coalition for harbouring Osama bin Laden, the architect of the September 11 terrorist attacks on America. There are no women on the Taliban’s negotiation team, led by their chief justice Abdul Hakim. Pompeo has said he expected the discussions to be contentious. Washington’s peace envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said on Friday that launching the talks is an important achievement, but that “there are difficulties, significant challenges on the way to reaching agreement”. “This is a test for both sides, for the Taliban and the government,” he said. “Can they reach an agreement despite differences, in terms of their visions for the future of Afghanistan?” The intra-Afghan negotiations were laid out in a peace deal Washington signed with the Taliban on February 29. At that time the deal was touted as Afghanistan’s best chance at peace in 40 years of war.           ",world

Huge fire breaks out at Beirut port a month after explosion,"  A huge fire broke out Thursday at the Port of Beirut, sending up a thick column of black smoke and raising new panic among traumatised residents after last month’s catastrophic blast at the same site killed nearly 200 people. It was unclear what caused the blaze at the facility, which was decimated by the Aug. 4 explosion when nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate blew up and sent out a shock wave that caused widespread damage and was felt as far away as the island of Cyprus. Dark smoke covered the capital on Thursday as army helicopters sprayed water over the orange flames leaping from the ground. The Lebanese army said the fire started in the port’s duty free zone at a warehouse with containers of tires, oil and other flammable materials.                ",world
China accuses US of racial discrimination over visa cancellations,"  China accused Washington of “political persecution and racial discrimination” on Thursday, after the US confirmed it had revoked the visas of more than 1,000 Chinese students under an order by President Donald Trump that accused some of espionage. Trump declared in May that some Chinese nationals officially in the United States for study have stolen intellectual property and helped modernise China’s military, as tensions between the two countries soar on multiple fronts. China’s foreign ministry hit back Thursday, saying the US should “immediately stop using all kinds of pretexts to restrict and suppress Chinese students in the US for no reason.” “This is outright political persecution and racial discrimination. It seriously violates the human rights of these Chinese students,” said foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a press conference on Monday. He said that China reserved the right to “further respond”. The US State Department offered its first figures on the effects of Trump’s order on Wednesday, saying more than 1,000 visas from students and researchers had been revoked since it began implementing the proclamation on June 1. “The high-risk graduate students and research scholars made ineligible under this proclamation represent a small subset of the total number of Chinese students and scholars coming to the United States,” a State Department spokeswoman said. “We continue to welcome legitimate students and scholars from China who do not further the Chinese Communist Party’s goals of military dominance.” The State Department declined to give details on whose visas have been revoked, citing privacy laws.

Top Belarus activist says authorities threatened to kill her,"  A prominent opposition activist who resisted her forcible expulsion from Belarus by ripping up her passport accused Belarusian authorities Thursday of threatening to kill her amid their efforts to end a month of protests against the country’s authoritarian president. Maria Kolesnikova said in a formal complaint released by her lawyer that agents of Belarus’ state security committee put a bag on her head and drove her to the border with Ukraine before she fought her removal from Belarus and was jailed. “They threatened to kill me,” Kolesnikova said. “They stated that if I refuse to leave the territory of Belarus voluntarily, they will get me out of the country anyway - alive or in fragments.” She demanded that the nation’s Investigative Committee probe the KGB officers on charges of abduction, illegal detention and threats of killing. Opposition activists came under increasing pressure this week as Belarus marked a month since massive demonstrations broke out against President Alexander Lukashenko’s reelection to a sixth term. The opposition rejects the results of the country’s Aug. 9 election, and the protesters demanding Lukashenko’s resignation represent an unprecedented challenge to the Belarusian leader’s 26-year rule. Kolesnikova is a leading member of the Coordination Council created by opposition activists to push for a new election. She was detained Monday and destroyed her passport in a no-man’s land between Ukraine and Belarus the next day to prevent her expulsion. Kolesnikova, who remains jailed in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, is accused of undermining national security as part of a criminal probe against senior members of the opposition Coordination Council. She faces up to five years in prison, if convicted. All of the council’s senior members except for Nobel Prize-winning writer Svetlana Alexievich have been jailed or forcibly expelled from the country.          ",world
"Prez Trump’s Peace Prize nomination hard-earned, well-deserved: WH","  The nomination of Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the landmark Israel-UAE deal is a “hard-earned and well-deserved honour,” the White House has said, underlining that the US President has made peace a cornerstone of his foreign policy efforts.

Vaccine still possible by yr-end despite trial pause: AstraZeneca,"  Drugs giant AstraZeneca on Thursday said a Covid-19 vaccine could still be available by as early as the end of the year, despite a randomised clinical trial being paused. “We could still have a vaccine by the end of this year, early next year,” the UK-based company’s chief executive Pascal Soriot said in comments at a media event. AstraZeneca announced Wednesday it had “voluntarily paused” its trial of a drug developed alongside Oxford University after a UK volunteer developed an unexplained illness. An independent committee was drafted in to review safety but the company said it was a “routine action” designed to maintain the integrity of the trials. “We will be guided by this committee as to when the trials could restart, so that we can continue our work at the earliest opportunity,” Soriot said in a statement. AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is one of nine around the world currently in late-stage Phase 3 human trials. In the US, the company began enrolling 30,000 volunteers across dozens of sites on August 31, and smaller groups are being tested in Brazil and elsewhere in South America. The vaccine, called AZD1222, uses a weakened version of a common cold-causing adenovirus engineered to code for the spike protein that the novel coronavirus uses to invade cells. After vaccination, this protein is produced inside the human body, which primes the immune system to attack the coronavirus if the person is later infected. The director of UK scientific research charity the Wellcome Trust, Jeremy Farrar, said there were often pauses in vaccine trials. He told BBC radio in an interview that it demonstrated the importance of conducting vaccine trials properly, with independent oversight and the involvement of the regulator.     ",world
Biden’s campaign firm hit by Russian hackers: Report,"  Microsoft Corp recently alerted one of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s main election campaign advisory firms that it had been targeted by suspected Russian state-backed hackers, according to three people briefed on the matter. The hacking attempts targeted staff at Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats, over the past two months, the sources said. A person familiar with SKDK’s response to the attempts said the hackers failed to gain access to the firm’s networks. “They are well-defended, so there has been no breach,” the person said. SKDK Vice Chair Hilary Rosen declined to comment. A Biden spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The hacking attempts on SKDK come as U.S. intelligence agencies have raised alarms about possible efforts by foreign governments to interfere in the November presidential election. Investigations by former special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate intelligence committee both concluded that affiliates of the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election, and Mueller has warned that Russia was meddling in the current campaign. One of the sources said it was not clear whether Biden’s campaign was the target or whether the Russians were attempting to gain access to information about other SKDK clients. SKDK managing director Anita Dunn was a White House communications director during the Barack Obama presidency and serves the Biden campaign as a senior advisor. The attempts to infiltrate SKDK were recently flagged to the campaign firm by Microsoft, which identified hackers tied to the Russian Government as the likely culprits, according to the three sources briefed on the matter.

General says US cutting troops in Iraq to 3K this month,"  The United States is reducing its troop presence in Iraq this month from 5,200 to 3,000, the top American commander for the Middle East said Wednesday, as President Donald Trump tries to make good on his campaign promise to get the United States out of “ endless wars.”  During a visit to Iraq, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said the reduction in Iraq reflects US Confidence in the ability of US-trained Iraqi security forces to handle the militant threat from the Islamic State group, which entered Iraq from Syria in 2014. Late Tuesday, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters aboard Air Force One that such an announcement was coming and that an announcement on the withdrawal of additional troops from Afghanistan also could be expected in the coming days. Trump has been trying to make the case that he has fulfilled the promises he made four years ago as he campaigns for a second term.      ",world
"Kabul bomb targets V-P, kills 10 civilians, say Afghan officials","  A bombing in the Afghan capital on Wednesday targeted the convoy of the country’s first vice president, killing 10 people and wounding more than a dozen others, including several of the vice president’s bodyguards, the Interior Ministry said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing and the Taliban quickly denied they were behind the attack. First Vice President Amrullah Saleh suffered minor burns in the blast. Saleh, who is also Afghanistan’s former intelligence chief, said in his first television appearance immediately after the attack that he was fine and had sustained only slight burns. He appeared in the TV footage with bandages on one hand. “ Me and my younger son who was also with me are fine,”  Saleh said in the footage. “ I have slight burns on my face and hand from the wave of the blast. I don’t have exact details right now, but I apologise to those who suffered casualties and those who lost their property in the attack.”  His spokesman, Razwan Murad, called the attack a “ vicious terrorist attempt”  on Saleh’s life. The roads in the vicinity of the bombing were closed off. The Interior Ministry says the bomb went off as Saleh’s convoy was passing through a section of Kabul with shops that sell gas cylinders for use in heating homes and cooking. The blast ignited a fire that set ablaze a number of the shops. The explosion left behind a scene of destruction — at least 10 shops were smoldering in the aftermath of the explosion that had also shattered windows of dozens of nearby homes, some with doors hanging off their hinges. Cars were wrecked and debris was scattered around. The Interior Ministry’s spokesman, Tariq Arian, confirmed to The Associated Press earlier that the bombing targeted Saleh’s convoy. Initially, Arian said at least two civilians died but the death toll later rose to 10. The ministry said at least 15 people were wounded.                 ",world
"In 3 big states, Biden looks to rebuild Democrats’ Blue Wall","  In 2016, Donald Trump tore down Democrats’ “ blue wall,”  winning the White House with surprise victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. This year, Joe Biden is trying to rebuild. The Democratic presidential nominee’s first pandemic-era campaign trips beyond his home in Delaware are taking him to all three states, an indication of how closely Biden’s electoral prospects are tied to his ability to flip those political battlegrounds. Last week, Biden traveled to Wisconsin and was followed quickly by running mate Kamala Harris, who held her own events there on Labor Day. On Wednesday, Biden heads to Michigan to tout a plan for boosting US Manufacturing. He also has two stops scheduled this week in Pennsylvania. Though the Biden campaign often emphasises that it sees multiple ways to secure the 270 Electoral College votes they need to win in November, the quickest path runs through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. “ If Biden wins any of them — but particularly any two, with some of the other states that are in play — it’s pretty impossible for Trump to win the Electoral College,”  said veteran Democratic strategist Joe Trippi. “ It makes tremendous sense to make those three states the base foundation of any strategy to win.

GOP portrays Kamala as anti-Catholic,"  Soon after Joe Biden tapped Kamala Harris as his running mate, some conservatives began trying to portray her as anti-Catholic — a line of attack that President Donald Trump’s campaign continues to amplify as Democrats court Roman Catholic voters. The charge stems in part from questions Harris posed in 2018 to a federal judicial nominee about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a lay Catholic fraternal organisation. Harris asked the nominee if he agreed with the anti-abortion views of the group’s leader, views that broadly align with the church’s stance. It inflamed Republicans at the time, with one senator authoring a resolution to affirm the constitutional ban on religious tests for federal officials and state that membership in the Catholic group is not “ disqualifying.”  Now that Harris is Biden’s running mate, conservatives are replaying the moment to try to chip at the pro-abortion-rights Democratic ticket’s appeals to religious voters. As Biden’s campaign launched its Catholic voter outreach effort last week, the Trump campaign blasted Harris’ questioning as “ anti-Catholic bigotry”  and said the Democrats’ stance on abortion “ clashes strongly with Catholic pro-life beliefs.”  It used similar language to refer to Harris alongside an online ad it rolled out last month. The criticism of Harris, who attends a progressive Black Baptist church — and by extension, criticism of Biden — is a sign that Republicans see his leftward shift on abortion as a vulnerability with some devout swing voters who might otherwise be lukewarm on Trump, particularly Catholics and evangelicals. It also plays upon the fact that Harris’ approach to religious outreach is less fully formed than that of Biden, whose lifelong Catholic faith is a touchstone of his political identity. “ We hope that Biden and Kamala Harris talk a lot about these issues,”  said Richard Mouw, president emeritus at Fuller Theological Seminary, who signed a July letter from Christian leaders urging Democrats to take a friendlier stance toward abortion critics. “ Because even though some of us disagree about Biden’s policies related to these positions, we think he understands us.”  Mouw praised Harris’ selection, adding that he hopes to see signals from her that she’s ready to “ keep talking”  and “ keep listening”  to evangelicals and conservative Catholics disillusioned with Trump.

Rights group: Myanmar Army deserters confirmed atrocities,"  Two soldiers who deserted from Myanmar’s army have testified on video that they were instructed by commanding officers to “shoot all that you see and that you hear” in villages where minority Rohingya lived, a human rights group said Tuesday. The comments appear to be the first public confession by soldiers of involvement in army-directed massacres, rape and other crimes against Rohingya Muslims in the Buddhist-majority country. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh since August 2017 to escape what Myanmar’s military called a clearance campaign following an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group in Rakhine state. Myanmar’s government has denied accusations that security forces committed mass rapes and killings and burned thousands of homes. The group  said the two army privates fled the country last month and are believed to be in the custody of the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands, which is examining the violence against the Rohingya. Asked about the two soldiers, an ICC spokesman said Tuesday that “We have no new persons under arrest.” The two men “separately claimed to be acting on orders from senior commanders to ‘exterminate all (Rohingya),’ to ‘shoot all that you see and that you hear,’ and to ‘kill all’ Rohingya in specific areas,” Fortify Rights said in a statement.

China detains 23 in crackdown on Inner Mongolia protests,"  Police in China’s Inner Mongolia region have detained at least 23 people following protests last week against a new policy that replaces Mongolian-language textbooks with Chinese ones in classrooms. The push to use the new textbooks, which started in other ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet in 2017, has prompted demonstrations and school boycotts by ethnic Mongolians in at least five cities and counties in Inner Mongolia. The 23 detentions were across eight banners, the regional word for counties, according to an Associated Press tally of nine local police reports over the past several days.  ",world
Julian Assange in UK court fighting extradition to US,"  Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange, who faces charges of computer hacking and espionage in the US, on Monday returned to a UK court to fight his extradition to the US. The 49-year-old Australian national, who has been in Belmarsh Prison for 16 months, is wanted over the publication of classified documents in 2010 and 2011 and faces a possible penalty of 175 years in jail if convicted on being extradited to the US. He appeared before the Old Bailey court in London where the court was informed of his formal re-arrest on a new indictment issued in June, during the coronavirus lockdown, by the US government. The fresh indictment contains 18 charges, including plotting to hack computers and conspiring to obtain and disclose national defence information. Wearing a dark suit, tie and white shirt, Assange sat behind a glass security screen at the back of the court and spoke only to say that he did not consent to his extradition. James Lewis, the barrister acting for the US authorities, accuses Assange’s lawyers of conducting a defence consisting of “an attack upon the President of the United States (which) ignores the institutional competencies of the agencies relevant to this case, the Constitution of the United States and the independence of its courts”.

Greece to boost military amid tension with neighbour Turkey,"  Greece will be bolstering its military with new armament programmes, a boost to military personnel and the development of the country’s defence industry, the government spokesman said Monday, as a tense stand-off with neighbouring Turkey has led to concerns of open conflict between the two NATO allies. Ankara is currently facing off against Greece and Cyprus over oil and gas exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Greece and Turkey have deployed naval and air forces to assert their competing claims in the region. “The Turkish leadership is unleashing, on a near daily basis, threats of war and makes provocative statements against Greece,” Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas said. “We respond with political, diplomatic and operational readiness, determined to do whatever is necessary to protect our sovereign rights.” Petsas said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis would be announcing details of plans to upgrade the country’s military, during his annual state of the economy speech on Saturday. “We are in contact with friendly countries in order to reinforce the equipment of our armed forces,” Petsas said. Last week, Greece raised 2.5 billion euros (USD 2.96 billion) in a bond auction as the country seeks to increase military spending and raise funds for businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Greek media have reported the purchases may include  French-made Rafale fighter jets and at least one French frigate. Petsas said Mitsotakis would be meeting with Macron on Thursday on the sidelines of a meeting in Corsica of European Union Mediterranean countries. Last Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Greece to enter talks over disputed eastern Mediterranean territorial claims or face the consequences.      ",world
"Belarus activist goes missing, colleagues fear detention","  A leading opposition activist and several other members of an opposition council in Belarus went missing Monday and their colleagues feared they were detained as part of the authorities’ efforts to squelch nearly a month of protests against the re-election of the country’s authoritarian leader. Maria Kolesnikova, a member of the Coordination Council created by the opposition to facilitate talks with President Alexander Lukashenko on a transition of power, was reportedly put on a minibus in the capital, Minsk, and driven away by unidentified people. Her disappearance follows a massive rally Sunday that drew an estimated 100,000 protesters pushing for the resignation of Lukashenko, who extended his 26-year rule in the Aug. 9 election that the opposition sees as rigged. A council member, Maxim Znak, said Kolesnikova’s colleagues fear she was detained. Two other members of the council also couldn’t be reached on Monday, according to Znak. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted that Kolesnikova’s disappearance is part of the Belarusian authorities’ effort to “cynically eliminate one by one” and called for her immediate release.

"Hospital: Alexei Navalny out of coma, is responsive","  Poisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s condition has improved, allowing doctors to take him out of an induced coma, the German hospital treating him said Monday. Navalny, a fierce, high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was flown to Germany last month after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia. German chemical weapons experts say tests show the 44-year-old was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent, prompting the German government last week to demand that Russia investigate the case. “The patient has been removed from his medically induced coma and is being weaned off mechanical ventilation,” Berlin’s Charite hospital said in a statement. “He is responding to verbal stimuli. It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning.” It added that the decision to publicly release details of his condition was made in consultation with Navalny’s wife. Navalny had been in an induced coma in the Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany on Aug. 22 for treatment. News of his gradual recovery came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office indicated that she might be willing to rethink the fate of a controversial German-Russian gas pipeline project — a sign of Berlin’s growing frustration over Moscow’s stonewalling about the case. German authorities said last week that tests showed “proof without doubt” that Navalny was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group. British authorities identified the Soviet-era Novichok as the poison used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018. Russia has denied that the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Navalny and accused Germany failing to provide evidence about the poisoning that it requested in late August. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Sunday that the Russian reaction could determine whether Germany changes its long-standing backing for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brings Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine.

Saudi court gives 7 yrs to 20 yrs jail for Khashoggi murder,"  A Saudi court issued final verdicts on Monday in the case of slain Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi after his family announced pardons that spared five of the convicted individuals from execution. Saudi Arabia’s state television aired few details about the final verdicts issued by the Riyadh Criminal Court against the eight Saudi nationals. Their names were not made public. The court ordered a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for five. Another received a 10-year sentence, and two others were ordered to serve seven years in prison. The trial was widely criticised by rights groups and an independent UN investigator, who noted that no senior officials nor anyone suspected of ordering the killing was found guilty. The independence of the court was also brought into question. Prior to his killing, Khashoggi had written critically of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in columns for the Washington Post. He’d been living in exile in the United States for about a year as Prince Mohammed oversaw a crackdown in Saudi Arabia on human rights activists, writers and critics of the kingdom’s devastating war in Yemen. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018 inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Among those ensnared in the killing are a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince’s office. The crown prince has denied any knowledge of the operation.  ",world
We do have 2 systems of justice in US: Harris,"  The US has two systems of justice for Black and White Americans, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris has said, as the Indian-origin Senator rebuked President Donald Trump and his Attorney General for denying there is systemic racism in the country’s justice system. The strong criticism from Harris, the first Black and Indian-American woman on a major party vice presidential ticket came less than two months before the US presidential election. Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate Harris are challenging incumbent President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence of the Republican Party in the November 3 election. Harris, 55, strongly criticised President Trump and Attorney General William Barr for denying there is systemic racism in the US justice system, saying they are “spending full time in a different reality.” “The reality of America today is what we have seen over generations and, frankly, since our inception, which is, we do have two systems of justice in America,” Harris told CNN in an interview. But she said she was optimistic that as a nation, Americans hold dear to an ideal that is inscribed in marble on the Supreme Court, which is that ideal of equal justice under law. “And so, while we have two systems of justice, we also fight for equal justice under law. And that means doing what Joe Biden and I are proposing, which is having a criminal justice system that, yes, bans choke holds and carotid holds, make sure that we’re going to require accountability for police officers who break the rules and break the law.” Harris said their administration would invest in communities and the economic strength of those communities, but doing it all recognising that there are huge disparities in the country based on race. “And it does us no good if we want to solve those disparities to pretend they don’t exist,” she said. Harris also suggested that President Trump was not a “real leader” on racial justice and was trying to “pretend that he has been a leader” on the coronavirus pandemic. “I don’t think that most reasonable people who are paying attention to the facts would dispute that there are racial disparities and a system that has engaged in racism in terms of how the laws have been enforced,” said Harris, a California senator and former state attorney general.  “It does us no good to deny that. Let’s just deal with it. Let’s be honest. These might be difficult conversations for some, but they’re not difficult conversations for leaders, not for real leaders.” Barr, America’s top law enforcement official, dismissed the idea of “two justice systems” told CNN on Wednesday. “I think we have to be a little careful about throwing the idea of racism around,” he said. “I don’t think it is as common as people suggest.”              ",world

"A Riot: Cops on Black Lives Matter rally in US city, dozens arrested","  Police arrested dozens of people and used tear gas against hundreds of demonstrators in Portland late Saturday as the western US city marked 100 days since Black Lives Matter protests erupted against racism and police brutality. Police quickly declared the rally a “riot” after protesters hurled Molotov cocktails at them, and they responded with a barrage of tear gas to disperse the crowd. At least one person was injured by the fire bombs, police said. Officers arrested dozens of protesters in an ensuing game of cat-and-mouse through a residential district of east Portland. “It was Day 100 for Black Lives Matter protests in Portland since George Floyd’s murder and they wanted to prevent us from marching,” said 20-year-old protestor Jay, her eyes red from the tear gas. “It’s our constitutional right to be here and to express ourselves.” Police said people were “engaging in tumultuous and violent conduct thereby intentionally or recklessly creating a grave risk of causing public alarm.” “This is a riot. Police are giving announcements to disperse. People are throwing Molotov cocktails,” Portland Police said on Twitter. The nightly protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis in May. Floyd’s death triggered similar protests nationwide, but it is in Portland — a city of 6,50,000 that is more than 70 percent white — that activists have remained on the streets practically every night, demanding racial justice and police accountability. President Donald Trump has cast the city as being under siege by “thugs” engaged in “domestic terrorism,” though the demonstrations have been peaceful for the most part. Tensions escalated again last weekend after a man identified as a supporter of a right-wing group was shot and killed. Earlier on Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in a park near Portland in a memorial for Aaron “Jay” Danielson, a supporter of the far-right group Patriot Prayer. The 39-year-old was fatally shot after he joined pro-Trump supporters who descended on Portland, sparking confrontations with Black Lives Matter counter-protesters. The suspect in the shooting, Michael Reinoehl, 48, was killed in neighboring Washington state as police tried to arrest him. The circumstances of Danielson’s death are still under investigation but Reinoehl appeared to acknowledge shooting him in an interview with Vice News. “We are in the midst of a civil war between good and evil, the good, the good is all the folks you see here,” said Dann, 50, who knew Danielson through Patriot Prayer, pointing to the families lined up near an imposing barbecue among camping chairs and numerous American flags displayed for the occasion. “The evil is the liberals who are letting these cities be destroyed by Antifa, BLM, whoever you want to call them,” he said. Apart from the homage to the victim and the groups of men with assault rifles or pistols, the atmosphere at the park in Vancouver, just north of Portland, was almost partylike. But Dann was gloomy about the run-up to the presidential election. “The next two months are going to be terrible. There’s going to be more violence. There’s going to be more atrocities. There’s going to be more name calling,” he predicted.  ",world

"17 killed, 20 hurt as 6 air conditioners explode in Bangladesh mosque","  A gas leak in an underground pipeline caused six air conditioners to explode almost simultaneously in a mosque during Friday evening prayers on the outskirts of Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, killing 17 people, including a child, and injuring 20 others. Worshippers were at Friday evening prayers when the blast sent a ball of flames through the Baitul Salat mosque in the central district of Narayanganj, officials said. At least 17 people including a seven-year old boy, succumbed to their injuries at Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgeryhere, the Dhaka Tribune reported. About 20 victims are undergoing treatment at the hospital and are stated to be in critical condition. Fire officials suspect accumulated gas from a leaked pipeline triggered a spark and all six air conditioners on the ground floor of the mosque exploded. “A gas pipeline passes beneath the mosque. We are suspecting that gas leaked from the pipeline and accumulated inside as the windows were closed. The explosion was probably triggered due to sparks when someone tried to switch on or off the ACs or fans,” Narayanganj Fire Service’s Deputy Assistant Director Abdullah Al Arefin was quoted as saying by the newspaper. According to reports, the mosque committee had recently filed a complaint over leakage of the gas pipeline of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited. Narayanganj Fire Service and police have already initiated investigation into the blast while the company formed another probe body to look into the incident. Narayanganj Superintendent of Police (SP) Md Zayedul Alam visited the victims at the institute and said action will be taken if they found evidence of negligence against anyone in its inquiry.

"Russia’s Covid vaccine safe, passes early trial test: Lancet","  Patients involved in early tests of a Russian coronavirus vaccine developed antibodies with “no serious adverse events”, according to research published in The Lancet Friday, but experts said the trials were too small to prove safety and effectiveness. Russia announced last month that its vaccine, named “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was the first launched into space in 1957, had already received approval. This raised concerns among Western scientists over a lack of safety data, with some warning that moving too quickly on a vaccine could be dangerous. Russia denounced criticism as an attempt to undermine Moscow’s research. In the Lancet study, Russian researchers reported on two small trials, each involving 38 healthy adults aged between 18 and 60, who were given a two-part immunisation. Each participant was given a dose of the first part of the vaccine and then given a booster with the second part 21 days later.            ",world
"Stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, China tells UN experts","  China issued a fierce rebuke Friday to UN experts who said a draconian national security law imposed upon Hong Kong poses a serious risk to the city’s freedoms and breaches international legal obligations. Beijing has faced a barrage of criticism over the legislation, imposed late June after pro-democracy protests rocked the semi-autonomous city last year. The law, which criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces, carries a maximum life sentence and has intimidated many protesters into silence. In a letter made public Friday, the UN special rapporteurs on human rights warned parts of the legislation “appear to criminalise freedom of expression or any form of criticism” of China. In customarily strong language, China’s foreign ministry was swift to strike down the allegations, saying the law “punishes an extremely small number and protects the absolute majority” in the financial hub. “Some people disregard the facts and maliciously slander China’s human rights situation... and crudely interfere in China’s internal affairs,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. “Stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China’s affairs in any way.” Hong Kong lurched into chaos last year as pro-democracy protesters — furious at perceived encroachment by China on the city’s freedoms — clashed with police. Unrest has simmered down thanks to coronavirus restrictions and the chilling effect of the security law — under which more than 20 people have been arrested, including a prominent media tycoon. The letter by the UN advisers — the first issued since the law blanketed the southern Chinese city — gave a vigorous dissection of the damage being inflicted upon the freedoms once enjoyed in Hong Kong, enshrined in an agreement made before the 1997 handover from British colonial rule back to China.

Will sanction Chinese officials for rights abuse in Tibet: Biden,"  Slamming China’s plan to further tighten control over Tibet, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that if voted to power, his administration will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in the remote Himalayan region. Noting that the Chinese Government recently announced plans to further tighten control over Tibet, thereby continuing to erode the human rights, religious freedoms, and dignity of the Tibetan people, the former US vice president said that these are only the latest efforts by Beijing to crush ethnic minorities that seek to preserve their distinct culture, language and beliefs. “My administration will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Tibet, and step up support for the Tibetan people, including by expanding Tibetan language services at Radio Free Asia and Voice of America to get information from the outside world into Tibet,” Biden said. Biden vowed that as president he will meet with the Dalai Lama, appoint a new Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, and insist that the Chinese government restore access to Tibet for US citizens, including American diplomats and journalists. “Where (President Donald) Trump has turned a blind eye, a Biden-Harris administration will stand up for the people of Tibet,” Biden said. In his statement, Biden alleged that Trump has been weak on his China policy. “Once again, the silence from President Trump has been deafening, as he focuses instead on his empty trade deal with Beijing and protecting his ‘very good friendship’ with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It’s disgraceful, though not surprising, that Trump is the first American president in three decades who has not met or spoken with His Holiness the Dalai Lama,” he said. “Trump hasn’t even fulfilled the statutory requirement to appoint a Special Coordinator to lead America’s efforts on this vital issue. It’s no wonder China’s leaders believe they have a free hand to deepen repression in Tibet, just as they have in Hong Kong and Xinjiang,” Biden said.             ",world

Students in Inner Mongolia protest Chinese language policy,"  Ethnic Mongolians, including students and parents, in China’s Inner Mongolia region are demonstrating their anger in rare public protests against a new bilingual education policy that they say is endangering the Mongolian language. A high school student in the city of Hulunbuir said students rushed out of their school on Tuesday and destroyed a fence before paramilitary police swarmed in and tried to return them to class. “We senior students were talking and we thought we had to do something,” said the student, Narsu, who like most Mongolians has only one name. “Although this doesn’t directly affect us now, this will have a huge impact on us in the future.” The policy, announced on Monday ahead of the start of the new school year, requires schools to use new national textbooks in Chinese, replacing Mongolian-language textbooks.

Putin’s critic poisoned with chemical nerve agent: Germany,"  Tests carried out on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny showed that he was poisoned by a Novichok chemical nerve agent, the German government said Wednesday, demanding explanations from Moscow. “It is a shocking event that Alexei Navalny has become the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve agent in Russia,” said government spokesman Steffen Seibert in a statement. “The government condemns this attack in the strongest terms. The Russian government is urgently requested to provide clarifications over the incident.” Tests carried out by the German army in consultation with the Charite hospital in Berlin, where Navalny is being treated, had found “unequivocal evidence of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok family,” Seibert said. Navalny, 44, fell ill after boarding a plane in Siberia last month. He was initially treated in a local hospital before being flown to Berlin for treatment.

Saudi allows overflights by UAE to all countries,"  Saudi Arabia has agreed to allow UAE flights to “all countries” to overfly the kingdom, state media reported Wednesday, days after allowing an Israeli aircraft to pass over en route to Abu Dhabi. Saudi Arabia has accepted an Emirati request to allow “crossing the kingdom’s airspace for flights heading to the UAE and departing from it to all countries”, the official Saudi Press Agency said, citing a source from the civil aviation authority. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile announced that Monday’s historic first commercial flight of an Israeli aircraft direct to the United Arab Emirates across Saudi Arabia would not be the last. “Israeli planes and those from all countries will be able to fly directly from Israel to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and back,” Netanyahu said, without giving any timeline. The announcements come after a US-Israeli delegation visited Abu Dhabi on Monday, on the first direct commercial flight from Tel Aviv to mark the normalisation of ties between the Jewish state and the UAE. Saudi Arabia has said it will not follow the United Arab Emirates in establishing diplomatic ties with Israel until the Jewish state has signed an internationally recognised peace accord with the Palestinians. But the kingdom has cultivated clandestine relations with Israel in recent years, in a shift spearheaded by de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In a sign of its cooperation with Israel, Saudi Arabia allowed Monday’s historic flight to cross its airspace, halving what would otherwise have been a long detour around the Arabian peninsula. However, Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s biggest economy and home to Islam’s holiest sites, faces more sensitive political calculations than the UAE. Not only would a formal recognition of Israel be seen by Palestinians and their supporters as a betrayal of their cause, it would also hurt the kingdom’s image as the leader of the Islamic world.

Biden campaign launches initiative to woo Hindus in US,"  The Biden campaign has announced the launch of ‘Hindu Americans for Biden’, as part of its efforts to attract the over two million members of the community in the US and address their issues, including hate crimes. Indian-American Congressman from Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi, is scheduled to address the first meeting of ‘Hindus for Biden’ on Thursday, the organisers said on Tuesday. The move from the Biden campaign comes over a fortnight after the Trump campaign on August 14 announced the formation of the ‘Hindu Voices for Trump’. In the November 3 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his Indian-American running mate Kamala Harris will challenge incumbent Republican President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.   This is, perhaps, for the first time in the history of the US presidential elections that the two major political parties have made an outreach coalition for the Hindus in the country.   ",world
Trump to wade into racial tensions with visit to Kenosha,"  President Donald Trump is diving head-first into the latest eruption in the nation’s reckoning over racial injustice with a trip Tuesday to Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the objections of local leaders. The city has been riven by protests since the Aug. 23 shooting  of Jacob Blake, a Black man hit seven times in the back by police. On the eve of his visit, Trump defended a teenage supporter accused of fatally shooting two men in Kenosha last week and accused Democrat Joe Biden of siding with “anarchists” and “rioters” in the unrest. Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, who deployed the National Guard to quell demonstrations in response to the Blake shooting, pleaded with Trump to stay away for fear of straining tensions further. The White House said the president was expected to meet with law enforcement and tour “property affected by recent riots.” “I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing,” Evers wrote in a letter to Trump. “I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.” Trump, claiming the mantle of the “law and order” candidate, is offering himself as the leader best positioned to keep Americans safe. Biden, in turn, has assailed him over the deadly protests that have sprung up on his watch. Trump insisted his appearance in Kenosha could “increase enthusiasm” in Wisconsin, perhaps the most hotly contested battleground state in the presidential race, as the White House said he “wants to visit hurting Americans.”    ",world
"Myanmar wriggling out of Chinese lair, reduces CMEC commitment","  Guess who is learning from the debt enslavement of Pakistan? It is none other than Indias eastern neighbour-Myanmar. After having noticed how countries have been honey-trapped by China through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Myanmar is holding back on sweet poison promises by China. India’s eastern neighbour has begun to re-look at a number of projects under the China Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), which at $100 billion is much bigger than the Chinese investment in Pakistan at $64 billion. The CMEC seeks to connect Yunnan province of China to Mandalay in central Myanmar and then fork off to the Yangon New City in the south and the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone in the west. The Kyaukphyu port will provide China with access to a strategic location due to its presence on the Bay of Bengal coast. Under the CMEC, which is nearly 1,700-km long, China plans to implement nearly 38 projects in Myanmar. Learning from the experiences of other countries, the latter has however, cleared only nine of these. Myanmar has taken a number of steps-stopping work on projects, setting-up commissions to review projects, break-up the bigger ones to make them manageable and also invite foreign consultants to participate in CMEC projects, crushing the Chinese monopoly. Interestingly, both-the generals as well as the political dispensation in Myanmar-have reached the conclusion that Beijing cannot be relied upon and the projects not only need minute scrutiny but a reduction in costs as well. The government has also realized that projects have to benefit the people of Myanmar instead of the profiteering Chinese companies. Towards this end, Myanmar has already unravelled the mammoth New Yangon City project and is now busy with finalizing an international consultant to hire a new developer instead of the China Communications Construction Company Ltd. (CCCC), which has acquired a dubious reputation in the execution of BRI projects globally. The project was estimated to cost $8 billion for developing a completely new township on a nearly 20,000-acre parcel of land. If executed, the project would have included five resettlement areas, two bridges, an industrial estate, commercial areas, residential habitats as well as the necessary infrastructure for all this construction and development. The fiscal size, the Chinese partner, and the location of the project unnerved Myanmar. The location selected by the Chinese was a flood-prone area and Myanmar was not comfortable with the CCCC. The size of the project deterred other possible investors, due to which Myanmar decided to split the project into manageable portions and reduce the quantum of investment. Myanmarese officials now plan to make the project transparent as well as hope to invite international companies by the end of the year. Myanmar has deployed many tools to water down Chinese greed and reduce the dragon’s interference. In June this year, Myanmar auditor general Maw Than warned his government about the high rates of interest charged by China on loans as compared to international rates. Of its total debt of about $10 billion, Myanmar owes $4 billion to China. He cautioned parliamentarians: “The truth is the loans from China come at higher interest rates compared to loans from financial institutions like the World Bank or the IMF. So, I would like to remind the government ministries to be more restrained in using Chinese loans.” Myanmar is also taking a critical look at a railway line connecting its Muse township with Mandalay in China. The gargantuan $9 billion rail project has not seen the green light from Naypitaw as yet. India’s eastern neighbour has not taken a decision over re-starting work on the $3.6-billion Myitsone Dam over River Irrawaddy whose construction had been stopped in 2011 by then-President U Thein Sein over widespread protests and public opposition. The government also realized that going ahead with the gigantic project would jeopardize its national security-China had complete control over the operation of the dam and its water flow. Almost nine years later, whether to construct or not to construct the controversial hydroelectric dam, remains a delicate decision for State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi. The government has, therefore, established a 20-people commission to review the project. Though the commission has given two reports, the government has withheld those and subsequently, the construction of the dam also remains suspended. Though Myanmar has been successful in reducing the size of the CMEC, one of the major successes has been the renegotiation over the Kyaukphyu deep water port project. It has been able to reduce the investment in the Kyaukphyu project from the initial $7.5 billion to $1.3 billion along with increasing its share from a mere 15 per cent to 30 now, ensuring that China’s share comes down from 85 per cent to 70. It is not just the CMEC which is a worry; the Myanmarese generals are openly critical about China providing arms and training to rebels along its northern and the north-eastern borders. The generals, who continue to remain powerful, have a major say in the running of the country. With the Chinese game plan unravelling in Myanmar, will India be able to step up its game and make itself useful to its eastern neighbour for a mutually-beneficial relationship-considering that both countries can do with more reliable friends around them.

Joe Biden accuses ‘toxic’ Trump of fanning unrest,"  Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of stoking violence after a week of deadly unrest catapulted law and order to the top of the political agenda barely two months before the US election. The stakes for Biden’s speech in Pittsburgh, in the swing state of Pennsylvania, could not have been higher a day before Trump heads to the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, to deliver his dueling vision on the upheaval. Emerging from months of Covid-19 travel restrictions, Biden finds himself suddenly on the defensive, mocked by Trump as weak in the face of events combining leftist anti-racism protests, riots, deadly shootings and right-wing vigilante actions in Kenosha and in Portland, Oregon. With Trump exalting in the shift of debate from his widely panned handling of the coronavirus pandemic to his favored theme of crime, Biden risks losing the momentum that has put him ahead in the polls for the November 3 vote. But the 77-year-old Democrat punched back, branding Trump’s presidency “a toxic presence in our nation.” “Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames,” Biden said. “The incumbent president is incapable of telling us the truth, incapable of facing the facts and incapable of healing.” While Trump has spent much of the past week warning voters they “won’t be safe” in Biden’s America, the Democrat sought to turn tables on the Republican in his 22-minute speech — delivered in a mostly empty hall due to coronavirus concerns — with the question: “Do you really feel safer under Donald Trump?” Trump “can’t stop the violence, because for years he has fomented it,” Biden charged. Trump “may believe mouthing the words ‘law and order’ makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.” Biden, who has been accused by Republicans of insufficiently denouncing violence by leftist anti-racism protesters, tried to set this to rest. “Looting is not protesting, setting fires is not protesting,” he said. “None of this is protesting. It’s lawlessness, plain and simple, and those who do it should be prosecuted.” At a White House Press conference, Trump still complained that Biden “mostly seemed to blame the police and law enforcement,” not leftist radicals.

Anyone challenging one-China policy will pay heavy price: FM,"  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday warned that anyone challenging the ‘one-China’ policy will pay a heavy price as he termed a top Czech Republic official’s visit to Taiwan as a provocation and short-sighted move. The Chinese government is under increased pressure over Taiwan after the recent visit of US Health Service Secretary Alex Azar to Taipei, the first high-ranking American official to visit the estranged island which China claims as part of its mainland. Azar, who is the highest-ranking Cabinet member to visit Taiwan since the US switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979, visited Taiwan in the second week of this month and met Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, a staunch proponent of Taiwan’s independence from China. Azar’s visit was regarded as the major diplomatic setback for Beijing which asserts that the ‘one-China’ policy constitutes the core of its foreign policy recognised by all the countries which have established diplomatic relations with it. After Azar, Czech Republic Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil started his visit to Taiwan from Sunday, ignoring Beijing’s prior warnings and met top Taiwanese officials. China’s state-run Global Times said Vystrci went ahead with the visit despite the opposition from the Czech president Milos Zeman. Wang, who was in Germany on Monday as part of his visit to the European Union countries, said Beijing will not tolerate the violation of its one-China policy. He said that anyone who challenges the one-China principle will pay a heavy price, referring to the Czech senate speaker’s Taiwan visit, the report said. Wang said Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory, noting that to challenge the one-China principle over the Taiwan issue is to make an enemy of 1.4 billion Chinese people and is a violation of international trust and conduct. Calling Vystrcil’s visit to Taiwan a provocation, Wang stressed that the Chinese government and people will not sit idly when challenged by the anti-China power and will let him pay a heavy price for the short-sighted move and political speculation. Responding to questions on Wang’s remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here on Monday that the anti-China forces in the Czech republic deliberately impinge upon China’ sovereignty and blatantly interfere in China’s internal affairs.

"Defying China, Czech Senate arrives in Taiwan","  The president of the Czech Senate arrived in Taiwan on Sunday on a visit that has drawn sharp criticism from China. Milos Vystrcil was accompanied by Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib and more than 80 representatives from government, business and academia, lending Taiwan a boost in its efforts to resist the diplomatic isolation imposed by Beijing. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu greeted the delegation at Taiwan’s main Taoyuan International Airport after their arrival on a flight chartered from Taiwanese flag carrier China Airlines. China last week denounced Vystrcil’s visit as “undermining the political foundation of China-Czech relations” and said participants were acting out of “their own interests.” “China condemns this despicable act and urges the Czech side to abide by the one-China principle and handle Taiwan-related issues in a prudent and appropriate manner,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters on Thursday. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and its increasing diplomatic pressure has reduced the number of the self-governing island’s formal allies to just 15, most of them small countries in the Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean.

"1 die in Trump fans, BLM clash","  One person was shot and killed late Saturday in Portland, Oregon, as a large caravan of President Donald Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters clashed in the streets, police said. It wasn’t clear if the shooting was linked to fights that broke out as a caravan of about 600 vehicles was confronted by protesters in the city’s downtown. An Associated Press freelance photographer heard three gunshots and then observed police medics working on the body of the victim, who appeared to be a white man. “Portland Police officers heard sounds of gunfire from the area of Southeast 3rd Avenue and Southwest Alder Street. They responded and located a victim with a gunshot wound to the chest. Medical responded and determined that the victim was deceased,” the Portland Police Bureau said in a statement. Police did not release any additional details and were at the scene investigating late Saturday. Portland has been the site of nightly protests for more than three months since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Many of them end in vandalism and violence, and hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested by local and federal law enforcement since late May. The caravan arrived downtown just as a protest planned for Saturday was getting underway. Police made several arrests before the shooting and advised residents to avoid the city core. The chaotic scene came two days after Trump invoked Portland as a liberal city overrun with violence in a speech at the Republican National Convention as part of his “law and order” re-election campaign theme. The caravan marked the third Saturday in a row that Trump supporters have rallied in the city. Trump and other speakers at this week’s convention evoked a violent, dystopian future if Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden wins in November and pointed to Portland as a cautionary tale for what would be in store for Americans. The pro-Trump rally’s organiser, who coordinated a similar caravan in Boise, Idaho, earlier in the week, said in a video posted on Twitter Saturday afternoon that attendees should only carry concealed weapons and the route was being kept secret for safety reasons. The caravan had gathered earlier in the day at a suburban mall and drove as a group to the heart of Portland. As they arrived in the city, protesters attempted to stop them by standing in the street and blocking bridges. Videos from the scene showed sporadic fighting, as well as Trump supporters firing paintball pellets at opponents and using bear spray as counter-protesters threw things at the Trump caravan. The shooting happened shortly before 9 pm Pacific, several hours after the caravan began arriving in Portland.             ",world

"Divisions emerge between Mali junta, opp leaders","  Bamako: Tensions mounted on Saturday between Mali’s military junta and the country’s longtime political opposition after the coup leaders failed to invite prominent opposition figures to a planned forum on the country’s political future. The meeting ultimately was cancelled and the junta leadership instead met with imam Mahmoud Dicko, an opposition leader who on Friday urged the junta to speed up the transition to civilian rule so the West African country could avoid further crushing financial sanctions. “I ask them to be part of the solution and not another problem,” he said. Only a week earlier, the opposition coalition known as M5-RFP that includes Dicko had publicly backed the coup, with thousands of their supporters taking to the streets after the junta’s overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. M5-RFP had led several months of demonstrations calling for his resignation three years before his final term was due to end.

Egypt police arrest leader of outlawed Muslim Brotherhood,"  Egyptian police arrested a high-level leader in the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood at his hiding place in Cairo, an Interior Ministry statement said Friday. Investigators recently learned that Mahmoud Ezzat, the acting Supreme Guide of the country’s oldest Islamist organisation, was hiding in an apartment on the outskirts of Cairo, the statement said. After searching the apartment, the police found computers and mobile phones with encrypted software that allowed the 76-year-old Ezzat to communicate with group members in Egypt and abroad, the statement said. Documents bearing the group’s “destructive plans” were also found, according to police. The statement did not say when the raid took place. It wasn’t immediately clear if Ezzat had an attorney. Ezzat had been at large since the summer of 2013, after the military removed Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, who hailed from the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsi’s short-lived rule proved divisive and provoked mass protests nationwide.              ",world
Allowing Nawaz Sharif to visit UK for treatment was ‘mistake’: Imran,"  Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that allowing former premier Nawaz Sharif to leave the country for medical treatment in the UK was a “mistake” and his government “regretted” the decision. Sharif, 70, was allowed to leave for London in November last year after the Lahore High Court granted him a four-week permission to go abroad for treatment. The three-time premier had submitted an undertaking to the court to return to Pakistan, citing his record of facing the law and justice, within four weeks or as soon as he is declared healthy and fit to travel by the doctors. In an interview with ARY News on Thursday, Khan said it was a “mistake” on his part to allow Sharif to leave Pakistan. He said his government “regretted” the decision to lift a ban on Sharif. “Now we feel embarrassed. Now he (Nawaz) has started doing politics [from] there as well and, when you see him, it seems like there is nothing (wrong) with him,” Khan said. In May, a fresh picture of Sharif having tea at a London cafe along with his family went viral on social media, sparking a debate on his health with the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf members demanding his return to face corruption cases. In the picture, he was seen sitting at a roadside cafe with his granddaughters. He sported a blue shalwar kameez and a cap and apparently looked in better health. The government came under criticism when last week Sharif’s photos surfaced, showing him strolling in a street, prompting calls from within the ruling party to bring him back.     ",world
"Misinformation, police mistrust stir unrest in Minneapolis","  After a Black man fatally shot himself on a pedestrian plaza in downtown Minneapolis, rumours of another police shooting in the city still reeling from the death of George Floyd began spreading quickly on social media, sending concerned residents and activists to the area — many of them anxious and some of them misinformed. Tensions and anger have been running high in Minneapolis since Floyd’s May 25 death, and some activists say community members are mobilizing more quickly as incidents occur — refusing to wait for explanations from a city police department they don’t trust. But others say the unrest that unfolded Wednesday — which damaged multiple business and resulted in more than 130 arrests — had nothing to do with anger, but was due to opportunists intent on committing crimes. “I just think that things have reached a boiling point and people are fed up,” said community activist Nekima Levy Armstrong. “Now we’re at a breaking point where there is no tolerance for even a hint of police abuse or police murder.” Emotions have remained raw over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes. Floyd’s death sparked protests worldwide, including several nights of violence in Minneapolis.                   ",world

Trump has shown reckless disregard for wellbeing of American people: Kamala,"   Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate, has blasted President Donald Trump for failing to protect the American people from the deadly coronavirus pandemic by being “fixated on the stock market” and caving in to China. In a blistering speech hours before Trump delivered his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention from the South Lawn at the White House, Harris alleged that the president’s policies have been “a reckless disregard” for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives. “Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people. Plain and simple. Trump showed what we, in the legal profession, would call a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people,” Harris said. With the Republican leaders attending the four-day convention largely downplaying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed over 180,000 people and infected over five million others in the US, Harris pointed out that Trump’s failure to address the health emergency more aggressively is emblematic of a tweet-driven presidency. “Here’s what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic: It’s relentless. You can’t stop it with the tweet,” the 55-year-old Senator from California told Trump. Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Trump froze and was scared. And he was petty and vindictive, she said. She said Trump “doesn’t understand the presidency” and believes it is “all about him.” The Republican convention is designed for one purpose: To soothe the president’s Trump’s ego, to make him feel good, Harris said.

Biden will be destroyer of American greatness: Trump’,"  Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden’s record as a “shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals” and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness. Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: “Joe Biden is not the saviour of America’s soul.” “He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.” “Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,” Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. “Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,” Trump alleged. During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. “This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,” he said.     ",world
China warns Norway against Peace Prize for HK activists,"  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, on a rare visit to Norway, warned Oslo against granting the Nobel Peace Prize to Hong Kong pro-democracy activists much on the lines of awarding the prize to China’s human rights activist Liu Xiaobo and Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in the past, causing strains in bilateral ties. Wang, who is currently on a tour of European Union countries to shore-up support for China in the face of the increasing pressure mounted by the US, is the first Chinese Foreign Minister to visit Oslo in 15 years. Relations between China and the US are at an all-time low over the coronavirus pandemic and strained trade ties. The two countries also recently closed each other’s consulates in Houston and Chengdu. Wang’s visit comes in the backdrop of Norway preparing to take up a rotational seat on the United Nations Security Council, of which China is a permanent member. Wang also held talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide on Thursday. Later, when asked during media interaction on how China would react if the Nobel prize would go to Hong Kong protesters in future, Wang said “I would only say one thing: In the past, today, and in future, China will firmly reject any attempt by anyone to use the Nobel Peace Prize to interfere in China’s internal affairs”. “China is rock firm on this principle. We don’t want to see anyone politicise the Nobel Peace Prize,” the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted him as saying. He called on Norway to cherish the current relationship, saying “If we can continue to respect each other and treat each other as equals … our bilateral relationship can continue to develop in a sustained and sound manner, and the political foundation of the bilateral relationship can be further consolidated.” Both officials stressed that this was the first visit to Norway by a Chinese foreign minister in 15 years – a subtle reference to the previously frozen diplomatic relationship between 2010 and 2016, after the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize committee awarded the prize to Chinese dissident Liu, the Post report said. China was also cut up with the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama in 1989. Till 2012, the Nobel Prize was viewed with contempt by China and its official media as it was awarded to the Dalai Lama for his peaceful struggle for the betterment of Tibetans and to Liu. However, Beijing welcomed the Nobel Prize for literature to Chinese writer Mo Yan in 2012, saying that Mo’s “victory reflects the prosperity and progress of Chinese literature, as well as the increasing influence of China”.

PLA fires ‘aircraft-carrier killer’ missile into South China Sea amid US spy plane intrusions,"  For the first time, China has fired its “aircraft-carrier killer” missile into the South China Sea (SCS) as part of the naval drills being carried out by the military in the disputed region amid aerial reconnaissance by US spy planes. China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years, which it says it has the right to defend. Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the SCS. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan. The SCS and East China Sea are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources. They are also vital to global trade. China launched two missiles, including an “aircraft-carrier killer”, into the SCS on Wednesday morning, a day after US U-2 spy plane entered a no-fly zone during a Chinese live-fire naval drill in the Bohai Sea off its north coast, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Thursday. One of the missiles, a DF-26B, was launched from the north-western province of Qinghai, while the other, a DF-21D, (aircraft-carrier killer missile) lifted off from Zhejiang province in the east. Both were fired into an area between Hainan province and the Paracel Islands, the Post quoted Chinese military sources as saying. Paracel Islands fall in the disputed part of the South China Sea. The DF-26 dual-capable missile is a type of weapon banned by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the US and Soviet Union towards the end of the Cold War. When the US withdrew from the treaty last year, it cited China’s deployment of such weapons as justification, the report said. The DF-26 has a range of 4,000 kilometres and can be used in nuclear or conventional strikes against ground and naval targets. The DF-21 has a range of around 1,800 kilometres, with the state media describing it the most advanced in the series, and the DF-21D, as the world’s first anti-ship ballistic missile. The missile launch was aimed at improving China’s ability to deny other forces access to the SCS, the report quoted sources as saying. “This is China’s response to the potential risks brought by the increasingly frequent incoming US warplanes and military vessels in the SCS. China doesn’t want the neighbouring countries to misunderstand Beijing’s goals,” the report said.  ",world
US imposes visa ban on China for SCS occupation,"  The US has imposed a visa ban on members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime, People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and some state-owned businesses responsible for the occupation and militarization of the disputed South China Sea. In a statement issued by the State Department on Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that from August 26 it has begun “imposing visa restrictions on People’s Republic of China (PRC) individuals responsible for, or complicit in, either the large-scale reclamation, construction, or militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea, or the PRC’s use of coercion against Southeast Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources”. The visa restrictions effectively ban the entry of not only the members of the CCP regime, the PLA, but also private individuals and businesses of the PRC, complicit in the occupation of the South China Sea. “These individuals will now be inadmissible into the United States, and their immediate family members may be subject to these visa restrictions as well,” the State Department said. In addition, the US Department of Commerce has added 24 PRC state-owned enterprises to the Entity List, including several subsidiaries of the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). Since 2013, the PRC has used its state-owned enterprises to dredge and reclaim more than 3,000 acres on disputed features in the South China Sea, destabilizing the region, trampling on the sovereign rights of its neighbors, and causing untold environmental devastation, the US Government said. The CCCC, the State Department said, led the destructive dredging of the PRC’s South China Sea outposts and is also one of the leading contractors used by Beijing in its global ‘One Belt One Road’ strategy. The US said that the CCCC and its subsidiaries have engaged in corruption, predatory financing, environmental destruction, and other abuses across the world. “The PRC must not be allowed to use CCCC and other state-owned enterprises as weapons to impose an expansionist agenda,” Pompeo said in his statement. The US, he warned, will act until Washington was convinced that Beijing discontinue its coercive behaviour in the South China Sea. “We will continue to stand with allies and partners in resisting this destabilising activity,” Pompeo said. The US supports a free and open South China Sea, he said, adding that Washington respects the sovereign rights of all nations, regardless of size, and seeks to preserve peace and uphold freedom of the seas in a manner consistent with the international law. “In July, I announced an updated policy regarding Beijing’s unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea and emphasised that the US was prepared to take firm action to oppose Beijing’s campaign of bullying,” Pompeo added.

Kenosha:,"  Police in Belarus detained over 50 people across the country during protests demanding the resignation of Belarus’ authoritarian leader, officials said on Wednesday. The renewed crackdown on protesters, who have been taking to the streets for over two weeks, comes as authorities crank up pressure on the opposition, jailing several activists, summoning others for questioning and selectively ordering dozens of demonstrators to appear in court. The Interior Ministry said 51 protesters were detained Tuesday at rallies that spanned several cities. According to the Viasna human rights group, 15 people were detained in Minsk, the country’s capital, where several thousand people rallied at Independence Square despite heavy rain, pushing for the country’s longtime President Alexander Lukashenko to resign. Protests broke out after official results of the Aug. 9 presidential election were announced, giving Lukashenko his sixth consecutive term, with 80% of the vote.     ",world
Thai police continue crackdown on pro-democracy activists,"  Police in Thailand continued their crackdown on the country’s student-led protest movement on Wednesday, arresting two more activists on charges of sedition and several minor offenses. Those arrested — Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree and James Panumas Singprom — are members of the Free Youth movement, a core part of a growing pro-democracy coalition that is demanding that new elections be called, the constitution be amended and harassment of critics of the government cease. With Wednesday’s arrests, there now are 13 activists charged in connection with the recent protests. All those previously arrested have been freed on bail. The arrests have done little to deter the activists, several of whom have returned to public protests even after their bail conditions could make them liable for rearrest. They have declared they will hold another major protest in September if their demands are not met. The activists believe that the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha came to power illegitimately because it was elected under laws established under a military regime that seized control in a 2014 coup ousting an elected government.

Turkey warns Greece not to test its patience over east Med,"  Turkey’s president warned Greece on Wednesday not to test his country’s patience or courage as the NATO allies remained locked in a tense dispute over offshore energy exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, while Greece announced plans to extend its territorial waters along its western coastline. The neighboring countries have sent warships to shadow each other in the eastern Mediterranean and held military exercises this week within an area between Crete and Cyprus where Turkey has a vessel conducting drilling research in waters claimed by them both. “Turkey will take what is its right in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean and in the Black Sea,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. “Just as we have no eyes over anyone’s territory, sovereignty and interests, we will never compromise on what belongs to us. We are determined to do whatever is necessary in political, economic and military terms.” Erdogan’s tough words came despite mediation efforts by Germany, whose foreign minister conducted shuttle diplomacy between Athens and Ankara a day earlier in a bid to deescalate the situation as Turkey and Greece engaged in competing military exercises at sea. “We invite our interlocutors to get their act together and to avoid mistakes that will lead to their ruin,” he said. In Athens, meanwhile, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Greece is planning to exercise it’s legal right to extend its territorial waters along its western coastline from six to 12 nautical miles. The planned extension along Greece’s Italy-facing coastline would not directly affect the territory at the center of the Greek-Turkish dispute. But the prime minister told parliament that Greece was abandoning decades of “passive” foreign policy. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas appealed to both Greece and Turkey on Tuesday to enter a dialogue and defuse the tensions, warning that “any spark, however small, could lead to a disaster.” His visits came ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Berlin later this week, at which Turkey will be discussed.

Floods in northern Afghanistan leave at least 100 dead,"  Heavy flooding has killed at least 100 people and injured scores of others as heavy seasonal rains drenched northern and eastern Afghanistan, officials said Wednesday. Annual heavy rains, compounded by mudslides, often threaten remote areas of Afghanistan, where infrastructure is poor.     Summer often brings heavy rainfall in northern and eastern parts of the country, leading to floods that leave hundreds dead every year. State minister for disaster management Ghulam Bahawudin Jilani said that in northern Parwan province, water inundated the central city of Charikar, where the health ministry said the local hospital was partially destroyed and many of the injured were being transferred to the capital, Kabul. The provincial spokeswoman, Wahida Shahkar, said the number of casualties may rise as people and rescue teams were still working to locate people buried under destroyed houses. The head of the provincial hospital, Abdul Qasim Sangin, said several children were among the dead and some of the injured are in critical condition. Shahkar said the flooding started in the central part of the province overnight, following heavy rains and destroying many homes. She called on the government to deliver aid and provide immediate support for workers digging through mud to reach those who were trapped. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in a statement ordered aid be delivered to Parwan and other provinces while expressing his condolences to the victims’ families. Ahmad Tameem Azimi, spokesman of the Disaster Management Ministry, said flooding blocked highways to eastern and northern provinces. “Along with rescuing people we are working to open the highways back to traffic,” he said.

China protests alleged US spy plane incursion during drills,"  China is protesting the alleged incursion of a US Air Force U-2 spy plane into a no-fly zone imposed during live-fire military exercises in the country’s north. In a statement issued late Tuesday, the Ministry of National Defense said the action had “seriously interfered in normal exercise activities” and “severely incurred the risk of misjudgment and even of bringing about an unintended air-sea incident.” “This was a naked act of provocation,” the ministry said, quoting spokesperson Wu Qian. China has lodged a stern protest and demanded the US Cease such actions, Wu said. The statement said the exercises were being staged by China’s Northern Theater Command but gave no details as to their exact time and place.      ",world
"Afghan officials: Taliban truck bomb, other attacks kill 17","  A wave of attacks across Afghanistan on Tuesday left at least 17 people dead and scores more wounded, officials said, including a Taliban truck bombing in the country’s north that targeted a commando base for Afghan forces. The violence comes as expectations had been rising that negotiations could soon get underway between the Afghan government and the insurgents as part of a February agreement between the US and the Taliban. The truck suicide bomber struck in northern Balkh province, killing three people, including two Afghan commandos and a civilian, according to Munir Ahmad Farhad, the spokesman for the provincial governor. According to Hanif Rezaie, the spokesman for the Afghan army corps in the north, initial military report said at least six commandos and around 35 civilians were wounded in that explosion, which also destroyed or damaged dozens of nearby civilians houses. “Most of the wounded civilians are women and children,” said Rezaie. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the Balkh attack in a tweet, claiming that “tens” of military personnel were killed. The Taliban often exaggerate their battlefield claims.  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani strongly condemned the attack in Balkh and said the Taliban have increased their attacks on major Afghan cities despite the February agreement. “The Taliban’s insistence on continuing war and violence is challenging peace opportunities,” he said in a statement. Ghani’s statement said the Taliban must stop fighting and killing Afghans, accept a cease-fire and start direct talks with the Afghan government. “By committing crimes and violence, they can achieve nothing but hatred and disgust of the people,” he said.

‘Biden-Harris will make US a socialist utopia’,"  Top Republicans, including Indian-American Nikki Haley, have warned Americans that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris’ victory in the elections will convert the US into a “socialist utopia” and a “fundamentally different” country. Urging the voters to re-elect Donald Trump for another term, senior party leaders in their prime-time address on Monday at the Republican National Convention presented the President as a statesman, a friend to Black Americans and a shield against an assault on American values. They said that the future of America was in danger if the November 3 polls resulted in the defeat of incumbent President Trump. The four-day mostly-virtual RNC the party jamboree will formally nominate 74-year-old Trump as the party’s candidate for the US presidential election. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will be challenged by former vice president Biden and his Indian-American running mate Senator Harris. Former US ambassador to the UN, Haley in her address said, “their vision for America is socialism. And we know that socialism has failed everywhere.” “Joe Biden and the socialist left would be a disaster for our economy. But President Trump is leading a new era of opportunity,” Haley, the two-time governor of South Carolina, said. Haley also sought to demonstrate President Trump’s leadership around the world, saying he has been tough against North Korea, Iran and China. She praised Trump for passing sanctions on North Korea and said he “ripped up the Iran nuclear deal.” “Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first. Donald Trump has always put America first,” she said. Haley also criticised the Democratic Party for “turning a blind eye toward riots and rage.” “The American people know we can do better, and of course we value and respect every Black life. The Black cops who have been shot in the line of duty, they matter. The Black small business owners who have watched their lives work go up in flames, they matter. The Black kids who have been gunned down on the playground, their lives matter too. And their lives are being ruined and stolen by the violence on our streets. It doesn’t have to be like this,” Haley said. She said that with Trump as president, “we will build on the progress of our past and unlock the promise of our future.”                 ",world
US allows emergency use of plasma treatment for virus patients,"  The US health watchdog has given emergency authorisation for the use of blood plasma to treat coronavirus patients in the country, saying the benefits of the treatment outweighed any potential risks. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Sunday that over 70,000 patients in the country had been treated with convalescent plasma, which is made using the blood of people who have recovered from coronavirus infections. President Donald Trump welcomed the move by the FDA on the eve of the four-day Republican National Convention which will renominate him to be the party’s candidate in the November 3 presidential election. “Today I am pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives,” Trump said at a White House briefing, referring to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.

3 Belarus opp activists detained in the capital,"  Belarusian authorities on Monday detained three leading opposition activists who have helped spearhead a wave of protests demanding the resignation of the country’s authoritarian president of 26 years following his reelection that opponents say was rigged.

Mali junta seeks to put off elections till 2023,"  The military junta that overthrew Mali’s president wants to put off new elections for three years, an official said Monday, as the international community pressed for an immediate return to civilian rule. The coup leaders want to prepare a new constitution before holding any vote, said an official in the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to journalists. The junta’s proposal will likely be rejected by West African regional mediators and former colonizer France: It’s more than double the time it took to hold a vote after a similar coup in 2012, and would allow the soldiers who overthrew a democratically elected president to remain in power for years. A mediation team from the 15-nation regional bloc known as ECOWAS has been pressing the junta to hand over power to a civilian transitional government. Initially, they called for ousted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita to be reinstalled as president, but that prospect has become unlikely amid an outpouring of public support in Mali for the coup d’etat. The official taking part in the talks indicated there had been some movement toward releasing Keita, who has been detained along with Mali’s prime minister since the coup a week ago. Among the options is allowing him to stay at his residence in Bamako under surveillance instead of at the military barracks in Kati, he said. African countries and the wider international community have expressed alarm over the coup d’etat, which deposed Keita three years before his final term was due to end. Mali has been fighting against Islamic extremists with heavy international support for more than seven years, and jihadists have previously used power vacuums in the country to expand their territory. The high-level regional delegation, led by Nigeria’s former president, Goodluck Jonathan, held talks with the junta, including Col. Assimi Goita, who has declared himself the group’s leader.               ",world
Pompeo hopeful other Arab states to forge ties with Israel,"  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hoped other Arab countries would also establish diplomatic relations with Israel as he kicked off a Mideast tour on Monday to press the momentum of the Trump administration’s Arab-Israeli peace push. Pompeo spoke at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, the first stop on a multi-country tour of the region following the August 13 announcement of the historic agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, brokered by Washington, to establish diplomatic ties. “I am hopeful that we will see other Arab nations join in this,” Pompeo said. “The opportunity for them to work alongside, to recognise the state of Israel and to work alongside them will not only increase Middle East stability, but it will improve the lives for the people of their own countries as well.” The Israel-UAE agreement delivered a key foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks reelection and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians. Earlier this month, the US, Israel and the UAE announced the deal to establish full diplomatic relations, which also requires Israel to freeze its plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank sought by the Palestinians as part of their future state. Later in the trip, Pompeo was to meet with Netanyahu’s partner in the government and Defense Minister Benny Gantz, as well as Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi.                ",world

He likes those who can contribute in batting, bowling and fielding. A bowler can have a bad day but he can change a match by grabbing a good catch or can win the batch with a six or a four,” Chahar told Aakash Chopra in his show Aakash Vaani. “If you look at our team, we have many players who are good in every department. T20 is a format that requires you to do everything. There are a lot of teams in the IPL which have a strong batting line-up or a strong bowling attack but they remain dependent on a few cricketers,” he said. bumrah enjoys freedom under ro India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah said the freedom he enjoys playing under Rohit Sharma's captaincy in Mumbai Indians set-up has been a huge confidence booster for him in his career. “For me, he (Rohit) has always given me the freedom, he has always told me to express yourself (myself), be whatever you want, be it any situation, take ownership of your own bowling, so that gives me a lot of confidence and a responsibility that I'm responsible for whatever I'm doing,” Bumrah said. “So that's a big thing for a captain because then he gives a bowler so much of confidence. He trusts you so much and he trusts the decisions that you will take and that's a very positive sign.” Ashwin pain has settled down Senior India off-spinner R Ashwin is hopeful of recovering from his shoulder injury as his pain has subsided considerably and the scan reports have been “encouraging” after a nasty fall during Delhi Capitals' IPL opener against KXIP.

Thanks for all your love and support,” Ashwin tweeted. Fleming hails Sam's attitude CSK head coach Stephen Fleming is impressed with debutant Sam Curran's attitude and said his contribution in the IPL opener went a long way in covering the absence of star all-rounder Dwayne Bravo, who is recovering from an injury. Sam played an instrumental role in CSK's five-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians. After an economical spell with the ball, the 22-year-old scored a quick-fire 18 off just six balls to help his side start the campaign on a positive note. “Losing Dwayne (Bravo) was a big loss and Sam went a long way in filling that,” Fleming told the CSK website. “The things that impressed us with Sam is his attitude first and foremost, almost the harder it gets the better he gets, his all-round skill component and the fact that the captain was able to trust him straightaway to go in at a crucial time and hit the way he did.” Hopefully will pull up well: Smith Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer said it was difficult to comprehend the ebbs and flows of a roller coaster IPL match against KXIP which ended in a Super Over win for his side. “It was difficult to see the game turning in different directions.

Real Madrid's attack scrutinized day after Bale's departure,"  Everyone seemed pleased when Real Madrid sealed the deal to loan Gareth Bale to Tottenham this weekend. It was a transfer that all parts wanted to make happen Bale wasn't happy in Madrid and the club didn't plan on using him. But a day after the Wales forward officially returned to the Premier League, Madrid struggled in attack in its Spanish league opener, sparking questions about the club's moves in the offseason. The defending champions were held to a 0-0 draw by Real Sociedad on Sunday, when the focus was on the team's attacking struggles. ""In general, we did well. The only thing missing was the goal and a bit of a killer instinct up top, particularly when the chances came our way,"" Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. ""Ultimately we struggled to create chances, particularly in the second half. In the first half, we had three opportunities but lacked that killer instinct."" Madrid wasn't expected to bring in anybody else to add that killer instinct or help make up for the absence of Bale, who had been one of the team's top names even though he wasn't much of a factor in Zidane's squad recently. Madrid was sticking to the forwards who had led the team to its first league title in three years last season, with French striker Karim Benzema supported by Brazilian youngsters Vin cius J nior and Rodrygo. The trio started against Sociedad but couldn't make much of an impact. Eden Hazard was supposed to play a big role as well but couldn't help much last season because of injuries, and he also wasn't fully fit for the opener on Sunday. Although the attack had thrived in the final stretch of last season, the team's poor run before that was largely blamed on the lack of scoring by the forwards, and the disappointing outing on Sunday raised concerns that the offensive struggles could be back. Also a reason for concern was Zidane's apparent lack of confidence in his other strikers. He had Luka Jovic and Borja Mayoral on the bench on Sunday but instead opted to bring in youth-squad forwards Sergio Arribas and Marvin, who also couldn't do much. ""We didn't want to change the system,"" Zidane said. ""You can bring your striker off and bring in two other strikers, but that changes the system, and I didn't want to do that."" Another player who may eventually help Zidane offensively is Marco Asensio, but like Hazard, he also had to deal with injuries recently and there will always be doubts about his condition. Zidane said he will have to ""look for solutions"" up front as the season advances. ""We know we have to improve in that area,"" he said. ""Defensively we did well and that's important. Now we are going to try to do things better in attack."" Madrid's second league match will be on Saturday at Real Betis, which won its first two games under coach Manuel Pellegrini. Madrid's game at Getafe on the opening weekend was postponed because it played later into last season in the Champions League. Madrid is trying to win back-to-back Spanish league titles for the first time since 2007-08.   ",sports
It really hurts to not close off game against Capitals: Agarwal,"  Crestfallen after losing their IPL opener, Kings XI Punjab batsman Mayank Agarwal said it feels terrible to not close off the game after making a stupendous comeback against Delhi Capitals here. Chasing 158 to win, KXIP were looking down the barrel at 55 for 5 but Agarwal's blistering 89-run knock took them to 157. They needed one run off the final two balls but Marcus Stoinis' twin strike took the game to the Super Over, which they lost on Sunday night. ""We had a tough day. There are a lot of positives to take out. The way we came back was fantastic, the way we bowled with the new ball was terrific. It really hurts to not close off the game from the situation we were in, feels terrible,"" Mayank told KXIP TV. ""This is just the first game. We can get things rolling again, let's see how we will go in the coming games. I think to play a game like that first up was fantastic. Everyone was up for it, guys really put in the effort. ""Definitely, we should have finished the game when we needed one run,"" he added. The 29-year-old from Bengaluru said 158 was a decent score to chase. ""It was a par score and going into the break, we knew that if we can stitch a partnership and not give them wickets with the new ball, we could win the game,"" he said at the post-match press conference. ""We batted extremely well to reach there. I don't know what to say (about the final moments)."" Mayank heaped praise on Stoinis, who smashed 53 off 21 balls as Delhi scored 57 in the last three overs to reach 157 for 8. ""Stoinis batted extremely well and even if we made a little mistake, he took us apart. So credit to him and he had a great game and he did really did well for them at the death,"" he said. Delhi's left-arm spinner Axar Patel said Stoinis form will ""have a good impact on the team"". ""If the team wants to go with six bowlers then you need an all-rounder and if he can contribute with both bat and ball it's really good for the team,"" Axar said. ""Stoinis performing like this in the first game itself means we don't have to change our strategy too much. It's good we won the Super Over and the morale is high in the dressing room."" Delhi didn't have a good start as they were reduced to 13 for 3 in 4 overs but skipper Shreyas Iyer (39 off 32) and Rishabh Pant (31 off 29) resurrected the innings before Stoinis finished with a flourish. ""We didn't expect we will lose three wickets in Powerplay. It happens sometimes you can't read the pitch quickly but the way Shreyas (Iyer) and Rishabh (Pant) contributed with their partnership, it gave us the momentum and in the end Stoinis completely handed us the momentum,""Axar said.

Stoinis shines in Super over win,"  Mayank’s fighting 89 goes in vain as DC sneak through  Kagiso Rabada once again proved to be the ‘King of Super Over’after Marcus Stoinis’ star turn with both bat and ball ensured a thrilling Super Over win for Delhi Capitals in an IPL encounter against Kings XI Punjab on Sunday. It was Stoinis whose late assault saw Delhi reach 157 for 8 in 20 overs with his 53 off 21 balls and 57 in the last three doing the trick. In reply, KXIP were looking down the barrel with half of the side back in the pavilion before Mayank Agarwal’s 89 off 60 balls took them to 157 before Stoinis came back to strike a double blow in the final two balls to set up a Super Over finish. Both the teams ended with score of 157 for eight and when it spilled to a Super Over, South African pacer Rabada conceded only two runs and took two wicket off successive balls to tilt in the favour of Delhi Capitals. Rabada had pulled off a stunning Super Over even the last year against Kolkata Knight Riders and like Andre Russell, this time it was Nicholas Pooran, who got a lethal yorker. It was difficult for Shami to defend two runs. Earlier, Shami’s exceptional fast bowling spell had put the Capitals on the mat as they had not crossed 100-run mark even after 16 overs but Stoinis’ whirlwind knock lifted the Delhi side to 157 for eight. The Capitals, sent in to bat, scored 57 runs in the last 18 balls with Stoinis punishing the bowlers with seven fours and three sixes. Punjab badly missed a good death bowler. Stoinis’ timely and gritty batting ensured that the repair work done by skipper Shreyas Iyer (39) and Rishabh Pant (31) did not go waste. The severe bashing demoralised Punjab batting line up, which fell apart in no time. However Mayank Agarwal emerged an unlikely batting hero, bringing Punjab back from no where. He, though, was dismissed when only one run was needed off the last ball of the innings but Chris Jordan could not score the final run, giving Stoinis his wicket and the match was tied. In Punjba’s chase skipper KL Rahul (21) was first to go and then India spinner R Ashwin sent back Karun Nair (1) and Nicholas Pooran (0) in space of five balls. It, though, did not end well for Ashwin, whose needless dive in the last ball to stop a single resulted in a freak shoulder injury. Ashwin landed on his left arm. Writhing in pain, Ashwin’s jersey became a temporary sling as he left the field. True to his reputation, Agarwal held the one end but Punjab needed Glenn Maxwell to fire, which did not happen as he could add only one run to his and team’s total. Half the batsmen back in the pavilion and no big-hitting batsman left in the line up, Agarwal’s heroic batting kept the game alive. He hit seven fours and four sixes. Earlier, the pitch had a tinge of grass, the ball was swinging and pacer Shami relished the bowling on a helpful track. His wicket-taking and run-choking act served the Punjab side well. It was a pitch that required patience from the batsmen but reckless shots was how Delhi Capitals began after being invited to bat, with Prithvi Shaw (5) paying the price for his extravagance and Shimron Hetmyer (7) failing to check his shot. Shikhar Dhawan (0) was run out to a horrible mix-up and the scoreboard was not a pleasant sight for the Delhi side at 13 for 3. However skipper Shreyas Iyer (39) and Rishabh Pant (31) respected the conditions to raise 73-run stand for the fourth wicket while Stoinis’ knock towards the end put Capitals in a psychologically advantageous position.

Kohli begins hunt for elusive IPL title as RCB face Sunrisers,"  Virat Kohli will begin his quest for an elusive IPL title when perennial under-achievers Royal Challengers Bangalore take on David Warner's low profile but consistent Sunrisers Hyderabad in their opening IPL encounter here on Monday. Both teams possess dangerous batsmen who can single-handedly take the game away from the opposition. Kohli has always led from the front but he knows his search for a maiden title will remain incomplete if the team doesn't perform in all departments. The addition of Australian limited overs captain Aaron Finch to the squad gives the star-studded batting line up more firepower. Expectations are also high from highly rated young opener Devdutt Padikal. On the other hand, Warner, whose exploits in the IPL include winning the 'Orange Cap' thrice and leading his side to a maiden title triumph in 2016, will once again pair up with the dangerous Jonny Bairstow. The formidable opening duo, that shattered multiple records including the highest opening partnership in IPL history against RCB last season, will hope to emulate the previous edition's exploits. Sunrisers also have the batting prowess of Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Mitchell Marsh and Fabian Allen. Following a nightmarish 2019 season when they finished last, RCB seem to have much better balance but there ability to hit late in the innings is yet to be tested. Sunrisers' blind spot also lies in the lack of depth in their batting order. The franchise has invested in youngsters like Virat Singh, Abhishek Sharma, Priyam Garg, and Abdul Samad and the management in the hopes that one of them could become the vital cog in the middle order. A team that is known for its depth and variation in bowling, Sunrisers' core unit remains unchanged. Bhuvneshwar Kumar will spearhead the pace department with Sandeep Sharma, Siddarth Kaul and Basil Thampi playing secondary roles. Armed with presence of the top T20 bowler Afghanistan leggie Rashid Khan and no.1 all-rounder in the format Mohammad Nabi, who was in a terrific form in the recently-concluded CPL, Sunrisers have one of the best spin bowling attacks in the tournament. They also have left-armer Shahbaz Nadeem. RCB also boasts of a potent spin unit, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will again be the key as he has been over the past seasons with Washington Sundar, Pawan Negi, Adam Zampa and Moeen Ali lending more options. RCB have also addressed the issue of their weak death bowling that plagued their campaign last season. The franchise has bought South African bowling all-rounder Chris Morris. At the helm of both sides are Australians, Sunrisers have appointed Trevos Baylis, who guided England to their maiden ODI World Cup title last year, as coach, RCB has placed its faith in Simon Katich to lead them. The Squads (From): Sunrisers Hyderabad: David Warner (c), Jonny Bairstow, Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Shreevats Goswami, Virat Singh, Priyam Garg, Wriddhiman Saha, Abdul Samad, Vijay Shankar, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mitchell Marsh, Abhishek Sharma, Bavanaka Sandeep, Sanjay Yadav, Fabian Allen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, KhaleelAhmed, Sandeep Sharma, Shahbaz Nadeem, Siddharth Kaul, Billy Stanlake, TNatarajan, Basil Thampi. Royal Challengers Bangalore: Aaron Finch, Devdutt Padikkal, Parthiv Patel, Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Gurkeerat Singh, Shivam Dube, Chris Morris, Washington Sundar, Shahbaz Ahmed, Navdeep Saini, Dale Steyn, Yuzvendra Chahal, Adam Zampa, Isuru Udana, Moeen Ali, Josh Phillppe, Pawan Negi, Pavan Deshpande, Mohammad Siraj, Umesh Yadav.

Experience Of 300 ODIs pays off in these situations: Dhoni,"  Chennai Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said his team's tremendous ""experience"" proved to be a crucial factor in its five-wicket victory over defending champions Mumbai Indians in the IPL opener. Ambati Rayudu and Faf Du Plessis set up the win with a 115-run stand for the third wicket, while Piyush Chawla was exceptional with the ball and was aided by likes of Sam Curran, Deepak Chahar and Lungi Ngidi. ""The experience pays off, everyone talks about it. You get it only after you play a lot of games. 300 ODIs is a dream for anybody to play and when you put an XI on the field, you need a good mix of youngsters and experienced players,"" Dhoni said. ""You need the experienced players to guide the youngsters on and off the field. The young players get 60-70 days with the seniors in the IPL,"" the veteran added at the post- match presentation ceremony. Dhoni also spoke about what all things the team learnt from the first game. ""We may practice enough but when you go on the field you need to assess the conditions and give it your best. It took time for the bowlers to find the right length on this pitch. Plenty of positives but still plenty of areas for us to improve ""In the second half there is a bit of movement till the dew sets in. If you don't lose wickets early, you have the upper hand. These are the learnings. Rayudu had a wonderful partnership with Faf. Most of us are retired so luckily no injuries as well."" MI skipper Rohit Sharma was upset that none of his batsmen could carry on the initial momentum that they gained. ""None of our batsmen carried on for us, like du Plessis and Rayudu did for CSK. I think we were 85 in the first 10 overs. Credit to the CSK bowlers, they bowled well at the end to pull back things. Something for us to learn,"" Rohit said. ""Still early days. We all want to start really well, it's crucial in this tournament where momentum is important. Few things for us to learn from this game, we did make few mistakes. Hopefully we'll rectify those and come out smarter in the next game."" Rohit said his team needs to adapt to the conditions better. ""We need to adapt to the pitches, it got better with the dew coming. You need to hit the gaps and focus on that part of the game. The opposition can tie you down, it's all about understanding what we need to do,"" he said.

Super Victory,"  CSK ride on Rayudu and new recruits to trump MI Mahendra Singh Dhoni hasn’t lost an ounce of his leadership acumen even after a 437-day hiatus as his battle-hardened Chennai Super Kings outfit beat Mumbai Indians in the 13th Indian Premier League opener on Saturday. Ambati Rayudu (71 off 48 balls) blazed his way and Faf du Plessis (55 not out off 44 balls) more than made up for Suresh Raina’s absence at No 3, helping CSK chase down a tricky 163-run target in 19.2 overs overs and with five wickets to spare. It wasn’t a jam-packed Wankhede rooting for the Mumbai Indians nor was it the passionate Chepauk stands with its Yellow Army in full fervour. It was a near empty Sheikh Zayed Stadium in the Arabian desert where Bryan Adams’ Summer of 69 or Rocky’s theme music Eye of a Tiger blared from the sound systems along with artificial crowd cheers. In this eerie set-up, Captain Cool’s brain kept ticking as his new recruits — leg-spinner Piyush Chawla (1/21 in 4 overs) and left-arm seamer Sam Curran (1/28 in 4 overs) — made fantastic first impressions while the new ball pair of Lungi Ngidi (3/38 in 4 overs) and Deepak Chahar (2/32 in 4 overs) came back brilliantly at the death overs. The skipper also sent match-fit Sam Curran at No 6 and his 18 off 6 balls ended any anti-climax that Rohit Sharma’s men would have anticipated. Giving less than 80 runs in the back-10 was the turning point and then the manner in which Rayudu and Du Plessis chased it after a scratchy start as MI maintained their record of not winning an IPL opening game since 2013. Trent Boult, with an in-dipper and James Pattinson, with a slightly dodgy decision going his way, removed Shane Watson and Murali Vijay respectively, making it 6 for 2 before Rayudu, in the company of du Plessis, launched a furious counter attack. One of the major aspects was how clueless Jasprit Bumrah (1/43 in 4 overs) looked during the day and it cost his team dearly.    ",sports
Shubman will bat at top order: McCullum,"  Kolkata Knight Riders head coach Brendon McCullum on Saturday made it clear that Shubman Gill will open for them throughout the IPL to give the team some solidity at the top in tricky UAE conditions. The rising top-order batsman was tried out at different positions last season without the desired result and it was considered to be one of the reasons why KKR missed out on a play-off berth. “They’re (wickets) gonna be quite fresh, I think they could be quite helpful for seam bowling. If the wickets are going to be a little bit tricky early on against fast bowling, I think you want your players who have the best techniques and the best batsmanship and craft,” said McCullum. “... He’s (Shubman) certainly one of those guys... I see him batting at the top of the order throughout the campaign,” added the newly-appointed KKR coach in a media interaction. Impressed with the way, the 21-year-old Shubman carries himself, the Kiwi great said he wants to give the Indian youngster his own space and groom the other junior members in the team. “I think he’s got a bit of a presence about him, even at this young age, very respectful as well. I know DK (captain Dinesh Karthik) really respects him as a person as a cricket brain as well. And I think he’s going to be another wonderful resource for DK both on and off the field,” McCullum said. “I want to see the most out of him is just to grow on his own time, his own space but also take those around him, who are still reasonably inexperienced and grow at the same rate that he’s growing in his own career. “If we can do that, then the experience we can get into these guys at a young age, and pressure moments is going to be a very, very good thing for KKR this season. He’s got a very big role.” KKR started off well winning four of their first five matches, but they lost six matches on the trot in the business end to miss the qualifiers by a whisker. The team looked really dependent on Andre Russell, but this time reigning World Cup winning captain Eoin Morgan will lend solidity in the middle-order. Hailing the Englishman as the best middle-over batsman in limited overs cricket, McCullum said: “He’s probably the best middle-order batsman in the shorter version, over the last couple of years. So we’re very lucky to have him. His relationship with DK throughout this campaign will give us a good opportunity.” The England limited-overs skipper, who had a stint with KKR from 2011-2013, was bought at the auction for Rs 5.25 crore. The 34-year-old Morgan will be joining the side after leading England to their maiden World Cup glory in 2019. “He was a guy who we were desperate to get batting (at the auction) in the middle order around Russell and Karthik... He provides us with a really, really strong middle-order.” KKR chief mentor David Hussey had earlier said Russell is best suited at No 3 but McCullum was of the opinion that the star Jamaican is an ideal finisher in the T20 format and the team will have a ‘horses-for-courses’ approach. “I think his game is definitely suited to probably the last 10 overs of a T20 game. But there may be times where the matchups are right we can get in Andre a little bit earlier, up the order. “That will be a horses for courses type approach but the good thing is we’ve got lots of resources to be able to choose from.” Clearly indicating that Russell, Morgan, Sunil Narine and Pat Cummins will be the four overseas players that he will mainly depend on during the tournament, McCullum said the team can really shock the oppositions if the wickets aid seamers in the initial few matches. “Cummins has the ability to take early wickets and if we can do that, we know we’ve got some quality spinners. When you couple them all together, I’m really content with the unit that we’ve got, particularly on these wickets because they might have a little bit more in them than what most people are anticipating,” he said. “If the wickets play as we expect, then I think we could shock a few really with the pace and speeds with which our bowlers can operate,” he said. With the overseas combination already set for KKR, Tom Banton may have to wait for his chances. “He probably won’t start for us in this campaign because we will go with a slightly different balance but what he gives you so many different options. He has already made a bit of a splash in International cricket,” he said. “He’s a guy who even against various bowling attacks of the world, can still shock them, and dominate them. And when he gets his opportunity, I’m sure he will entertain the fans all around the world.”    ",sports
KL looking to play good brand of cricket,"  Kings XI Punjab skipper KL Rahul on Saturday said the side is motivated to making this IPL season a memorable one by playing a good brand of cricket. “The team has been fantastic, we’ve been getting along great and are looking forward to playing a good brand of cricket and making this season a memorable one,” Rahul said. “We’re confident, we’re motivated and we are really excited to be a part of this edition of the Indian Premier League,” he added. Rahul, who has been handed the Kings XI Punjab captaincy after two stellar seasons with the bat at the top of the order, said it will be a challenging experience playing in the UAE without the fans but the team is ready for it. “It is going to be a different experience this year, but we as a team are up to the challenge and are playing for all the fans who continue to support us,” Rahul said. KXIP, who have never won the IPL, are aiming to go all the way this time with a strong squad at their disposal with the likes of Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Mohammad Shami and overseas recruits Chris Gayle, Glenn Maxwell, Sheldon Cottrell, Jimmy Neesham, the in-form Nicholas Pooran and Mujeeb Zadran. “The team looks great and we have a top-notch line up this season. The boys have been working really hard and we have a nice balance of youth and experience in our squad,” head Coach Anil Kumble said. “We are all looking forward to having a good season this year. I truly believe that Kings XI Punjab have the necessary squad to go all the way in this IPL,” he added.    ",sports
"Smith, Archer, Buttler clear Covid-19 tests","   Captain Steve Smith along with star players Jofra Archer and Jos Buttler have cleared the mandatory Covid-19 test on arrival and are available to play Rajasthan Royal’s IPL opener against Chennai Super Kings at the Sharjah Cricket ground on September 22. The trio were part of the 21-strong contingent of Australia and England players, who arrived in the UAE from UK by a special chartered flight on September 17. “Smith, Buttler and Archer underwent Covid-19 tests on Friday and results are negative. So they are available for selection with quarantine duration being reduced to 36 hours,” an IPL source said. Former Australia skipper Smith has had concussion problems and missed all three ODIs against England and his participation in the opening game is subject to clearance from both franchise and Cricket Australia’s medical team. If Smith misses the first game, Buttler could lead the side as he is one of the seniormost players in the team. As of now, the franchise is hopeful that Smith will clear the mandatory concussion tests and be available from the first game itself.                ",sports
Liverpool seal swoop for Wolves forward Jota,"  Liverpool sealed the signing of Portugal forward Diogo Jota from Wolves for a reported £41 million ($54 million) on Saturday. Jota has signed a “long-term” contract with the Premier League champions, which is believed to be a five-year agreement. The 23-year-old joins Liverpool just 24 hours after they signed Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara for an initial £20 million. Jota will provide attacking depth for Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, competing with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane for playing time in the wide positions in the team’s three-man forward line. “It’s just a really exciting moment for me and my family,” Jota told Liverpool’s website. “All of my path since I was a kid and now, to join a club like Liverpool — the world champions — is just unbelievable. I just want to get started.” Jota claimed the move to Anfield was too good an opportunity to turn down. “When you look at the Premier League, you always see Liverpool as one of the biggest teams in the country, so it’s impossible to say no,” he said. “So we just want to come (to the club), to give our best and hopefully I can become a good option for Liverpool in the future.” Earlier on Saturday, Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo had confirmed Jota would be moving to Merseyside. “Diogo is amazing and everybody knows the relationship we built. What Diogo did for us is absolutely fantastic,” he said. “I think Diogo is going to the right place and we wish him all the best, knowing that it will never be forgotten, especially by our fans, all the memorable moments that Diogo provided.” Former Atletico Madrid forward Jota joined Wolves on loan in their 2017-18 Championship-winning campaign before making a permanent switch in 2018. While Jota’s departure is a blow for Wolves, they can look forward to the arrival of 18-year-old Dutch defender Ki-Jana Hoever from Liverpool as part of the Jota deal.  ",sports
Bayern love to score 8,"  Leroy Sane said all-conquering Bayern Munich crave even more silverware after the Germany winger scored on his debut in Friday’s historic 8-0 thrashing of Schalke in the opening game of the new Bundesliga season. “We’re still hungry, even though we won the treble last season,” said Sane after creating two goals for Serge Gnabry, who claimed a hat-trick in the goalfest at the Allianz Arena. “Winning our first game at home 8-0 is obviously super. It felt really, really good finally to be able to play with the lads,” said Sane, who spent most of last season sidelined at former club Manchester City after tearing knee ligaments at the very start of last season. “It’s been a very good day with lots of goals.” Just 26 days after winning the Champions League final, Bayern picked up where they left off last season with their 22nd-straight win. Gnabry opened the scoring with just four minutes gone with a great piece of finishing which gave Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann no chance. Burly central midfielder Goretzka grabbed the second against his former club when he hit the bottom corner from the edge of the box on 19 minutes. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga’s top scorer last season with 34 goals, opened his account for 2020/21 with half an hour gone. He netted a penalty after being brought down in the area by Schalke defender Ozan Kabak, who has been linked to a move to Liverpool. It was 3-0 at half-time, but Gnabry grabbed his second two minutes after the break when he fired into an empty net after a sprint by Sane pulled Faehrmann out of position. The pair combined again when Sane chested the ball down after getting in behind the defence and rolled the ball off to the waiting Gnabry to claim his hat-trick just before the hour mark. Mueller added the sixth on 69 minutes after Lewandowski had again cut Schalke’s defence to shreds. The records were sent tumbling as Sane marked his debut with the seventh on 71 minutes when he sprinted onto Joshua Kimmich’s superb pass and fired home with Lewandowski unmarked outside him. Musiala, who only turned 17 in February, became the club’s youngest scorer in the Bundesliga when he darted in from the left wing to add the eighth on 81 minutes.  ",sports
United stunned,"  Crystal Palace beat Solskjaer's shambolic Red Devils 3-1 at Old Trafford DWilfried Zaha returned to haunt Manchester United with a deadly double as Crystal Palace landed a dramatic 3-1 win to leave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reeling. Just as they did in the early weeks of last season, Palace took all three points from their trip to Old Trafford, as a brittle United team were picked apart. Andros Townsend hit a seventh-minute opener but the match was still in the balance with around 20 minutes to play when Palace were awarded a penalty, after Jordan Ayew’s flick struck the hand of Victor Lindelof. Goalkeeper David de Gea looked to have made himself a hero when he saved the softly struck penalty from Ayew, only for a re-take to be ordered, and this time former United winger Zaha stepped up to smash the ball high into the net. United new boy Donny van de Beek pulled one back, but Zaha added a third Palace goal in the 85th minute, holding off weak link Lindelof and drilling beyond De Gea from the edge of the penalty area. Hat-trick for DCL Dominic Calvert-Lewin hit a hat-trick and James Rodriguez bagged his first Premier League goal as Everton crushed 10-man West Bromwich Albion 5-2 to extend their perfect start to the season. Carlo Ancelotti’s side fell behind to Grady Diangana’s early goal at Goodison Park. But Calvert-Lewin equalised and James put them ahead before West Brom imploded. Kieran Gibbs was dismissed for pushing James in the face in first half stoppage-time. Then Albion boss Slaven Bilic was sent to the stands after storming onto the pitch for a furious rant at referee Mike Dean. Matheus Pereira equalised for Albion after the interval, but Michael Keane restored Everton’s lead and Calvert-Lewin sealed the points with his second and third goals. At 23, Calvert-Lewin is the youngest Englishman to score a Premier League hat-trick for Everton. After a summer spending spree, Ancelotti is under pressure to deliver a big improvement on last season’s 12th place finish and the early signs are promising. Having beaten Tottenham in their opening game last weekend, Everton have started a Premier League season with consecutive victories for the first time since 2012-13. Calvert-Lewin already has four goals and Colombia midfielder James, making his first home appearance since his £12 million from Real Madrid, looks a quality addition. If West Brom are to avoid an immediate return to the Championship, they will have to improve their defence rapidly after shipping eight goals in successive defeats. Diangana put West Brom ahead in the 10th minute when he advanced from inside his own half before drilling a long-range drive past Jordan Pickford. Calvert-Lewin equalised in the 31st minute with a back-heel from virtually on the goalline after Albion defender Darnell Furlong inadvertently headed Seamus Coleman’s cross into his path. The goal was initially disallowed for offside before a VAR review changed the decision in Everton’s favour. James put Everton in front in the 45th minute when he took Richarlison’s pass and lashed a fine low finish into the far corner from 20 yards. Gibbs added to West Brom’s woes when he was sent off for lashing out at James in retaliation for a challenge by the Colombian. Bilic lost his cool as well moments later, angrily telling Dean that his decisions could “kill” his team. Now watching from the stands after his dismissal, Bilic saw Pereira equalise with a superb free-kick in the 47th minute. But Keane poked Everton back in front after Richarlison’s header was pushed out by Sam Johnstone in the 54th minute. Calvert-Lewin struck again in the 62nd minute, the striker sliding in to meet Richarlison's cross with a close-range finish. And Calvert-Lewin’s red-hot start to the season continued four minutes later when he completed his hat-trick as the ball bounced off his back into the net. Leeds on right side This time, Leeds was on the right end of a 4-3 thriller in the Premier League. A week after losing at champion Liverpool by the same score line on the opening day of the season, Leeds was involved in another wild contest in its first home game back in the division and came out on top against fellow promoted team Fulham. Helder Costa scored in each half for Leeds, the second goal proving to be the winner at an empty Elland Road for Marcelo Bielsa’s attack-minded side. Fulham, which had two goals from striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, has now lost back-to-back games to open the season, having already been beaten 3-0 by Arsenal. Between them, Leeds and Fulham have conceded 14 goals in four games so far. West Bromwich Albion, the other side promoted from the second-tier Championship for this season, has conceded eight. Costa gave Leeds a fifth-minute lead by slamming a shot in off the bar from an acute angle after Fulham midfielder Harrison Reed inadvertently flicked on a corner by the hosts. Penalties have been a feature of the first two rounds of the league and there were two in six minutes here. In the 35th, Mitrovic converted a spot kick after Robin Koch tripped Joe Bryan, despite trying to pull out of his attempted tackle. Koch also gave away a penalty at Anfield last weekend. Mateusz Klich replied with one of his own for Leeds in the 41st after Bryan pushed Patrick Bamford in the back. Bamford then scored for the second straight match by stroking home a finish following a pass from Klich, before providing the cross that Costa swept in in the 57th for 4-1. Fulham fought back through goals by Bobby Reid in the 62nd — four minutes after coming on as a substitute — and Mitrovic in the 67th but Leeds held on.    ",sports

"Woods, Mickelson, defending champ Woodland miss US Open cut","  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are heading home, hot-footing it out of Winged Foot after missing the cut at the US Open. Defending champion Gary Woodland also will be watching this weekend when his replacement is crowned in the pandemic-delayed tournament outside of New York City. ""It's never easy to not be playing for the championship on a weekend,"" said Woods, who with the pandemic-shuffled schedule will have a chance to add to his total of 15 major victories at the Masters in November and again in April. ""The whole goal of entering an event is to win,"" he said after following an opening-round 73 with a 77 on Friday to miss the cut four strokes. ""When I don't give myself an opportunity to do that, it doesn't feel good."" A total of 62 player reached the weekend after finishing the first 36 holes at 6 over or better. John Pak (+5) wrapped up low amateur honors as the only one to make the cut. Shane Lowry followed a 76 in the first round with a 70 on Friday, finishing up in the morning and then heading home to hope his score would hold up. ""Look, I'll have a long afternoon sitting back, watching TV, praying for guys to make bogeys,"" he said with half the field yet to play. ""That's where I'm at now."" He got his wish and will stay around for the weekend. Not so lucky was Woods. He missed the cut for the eighth time in his last 15 majors after missing the cut at one just three times in a span from 1996-2014. ""It's frustrating that I'm not going to be here for the weekend and be able to compete for this great championship,"" he said. ""It feels like the way the golf course is changing, is turning, that anybody who makes the cut has the opportunity to win this championship. I didn't get myself that opportunity."" Mickelson is a six-time US Open runner-up hoping to complete the career Grand Slam at the course where he had his biggest disappointment. In 2006, he took a one-shot lead into the 18th hole before an errant drive led to a double bogey that gave Geoff Ogilvy the trophy. The five-time major champion shot 79 on Thursday -- just one stroke out of last place. A 74 in the second round wasn't much to build on. ""It's fun for me to return; it's fun for me to come back here,"" he said, adding that he missed interacting with the New York galleries on the empty course. ""I love the people here and I'm sorry they weren't able to come out to the tournament. But I think it's one of the best golf courses that we play, and play majors on. And it was fun for me to have to play and compete here one more time."" Woodland was 13 under last year to spoil Brooks Koepka's bid to match a 114-year-record with his third straight national championship. It was the lowest 72-hole total in six US Opens at Pebble Beach. ""This meant a lot to me, coming back here defending,"" he said. ""I put a lot of time and effort into it, and if your body doesn't let you do it, you just can't do it, and that's frustrating."" But his title defense never got going because of a torn labrum in his left hip. He shot 74 on both days, starting off Friday's round with a double bogey on No. 10 and then making bogey on three straight holes Nos. 15-17. ""I've got a lot of pain in there, and I've been fighting through it,"" he said. ""But it gets to a point where you're playing against the best players in the world, you just can't play with pain. I've played with pain my whole life, but it's getting a little tough.""

Silverwood wants England players in IPL to guard against burn-out,"  England head coach Chris Silverwood has no doubt that competing in a world class event like IPL will help his players prepare well for the T20 World Cup but is worried about players burning themselves out. As many as 10 England players, including seven cricketers who were involved in the recent limited over series against Australia, reached UAE on Thursday from the United Kingdom ahead of the IPL which begins on Saturday. Silverwood said the players need to be cautious against burn-out as they have to stay in the bio-bubble for another seven weeks. ""It's their decision really but we'll have to keep an eye on them,"" he said after England's three-wicket defeat in the third ODI at Manchester. ""Obviously, the contracts are good for them but equally as well we're looking forward at a T20 World Cup. The more high-class T20 they can play will be a good thing for us."" ""The one thing that I have encouraged is that they keep talking to us. We need to make sure that they don't burn out as well."" The next T20 World Cup is scheduled to be held in India next year in October-November. England trio of Jos Buttler, Tom Curran and Jofra Archer will play for Rajasthan Royals, while England white-ball skipper Eoin Morgan will turn up for Kolkata Knight Riders, alongside Tom Banton. Moeen Ali (Royal Challengers Bangalore), Jonny Bairstow (Sunrisers Hyderabad) and Sam Curran (Chennai Super Kings) are among other England players who will feature in the IPL this year. Archer, who was sanctioned for breaching the bio-bubble during the Test series against the West Indies, has hinted that the white-ball leg was more enjoyable than the Test camps. Silverwood said: ""Jofra's found being locked up difficult at times. He's not the only player, there's been quite a few. We have to do it and I'm very proud of how the guys have dealt with it."" ""It's a juggling act of keeping people fresh in the mind. When people have asked to get out of the bubble, we've got them out. We said we would and we have. It's a case of making sure we don't burn people out.""   ",sports
CA working in tandem with Royals over Smith’s concussion,"  Cricket Australia on Thursday revealed that Steve Smith is following “concussion protocols” which are crucial for his return to cricket in the IPL and asserted that it is “not willing” to compromise with the fitness of the Rajasthan Royals skipper. CA said it is working in tandem with RR to ensure his smooth return to competitive action after missing the entire England ODI series due to the concussion suffered during training. “Cricket Australia has strict protocols when it comes to head impacts and concussions and, as we’ve seen over the last 12 months, we’re not willing to compromise on those,” CA’s head of sports science Alex Kountouris said in a statement. “Steve is making progress and working with our medical team through the concussion protocols required to return to play,” he added. Smith was hit on the head during a net session prior to the first ODI in Manchester and since then recovered well but not enough to play a competitive cricket. Kountouris said the franchise and CA will be working together to monitor Smith’s fitness upon his arrival in the UAE. Smith had also endured a concussion during last year’s Ashes game at the Lord’s and subsequently missed a Test match.  ",sports
Nitish hopes to learn from Morgan’s leadership qualities,"  Kolkata Knight Riders left-handed batsman Nitish Rana is excited to play alongside Eoin Morgan and hopes that he will imbibe some of reigning World Cup-winning skipper’s leadership qualities. The England limited-overs skipper was bought at the auction for Rs 5.25 crore as he’s set to reunite with the franchise after his stint from 2011-2013. The 34-year-old will be joining the side after leading England to their maiden World Cup glory in 2019 and Rana, who led Delhi at domestic level, is excited. “I hope I also have that sort of leadership quality so that it helps in my domestic team and I grow as a player,” Rana said in a media interaction. “He is one such rare left-handed batsman who dominates white ball cricket. He’s a World Cup-winning captain of a successful country. I’m looking forward to learning many things from him.” On the slow pitches in the UAE, a pace-heavy KKR line-up will have limited spin resources in Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav. Rana, who bowls part-time offspin, is also looking forward to get some more overs under his belt this time. “Bowling is not a new thing to me. I’ve been bowling in domestic cricket. It’s good that spinners will get an advantage here so that I also will get some grip. I’ve improved as a player and a bowler. Hope I get more overs and help the team.” The left-hander said he does not have a fixed batting slot and is ready to serve the team at any position. “I will bat as per team demand. I don’t have a fixed batting slot. I’m available to serve the team at any spot.” Having served long injury lay-offs respectively, the 2018 U-19 World Cup winning duo of Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi are back in full throttle, Rana said. “Nagarkoti was unfortunate to be injured for two years. He’s back strong. But this time, both of them are back in full rhythm and clocking 140kph-plus consistently. It will be challenging for any batsman. I hope they will do well,” he added.  ",sports
Messi nets 2 in friendly win,"  Lionel Messi scored his first goals of Barcelona’s preseason as coach Ronald Koeman left Luis Suárez and Arturo Vidal off his team for a second friendly match. Messi netted two goals and set up one more in a 3-1 victory over second-tier Girona, Barcelona’s second training match since Koeman took over as coach. The goals were also Messi’s first since his failed attempt to leave the club this offseason. Barcelona posted a photo on Twitter of Messi and Koeman clasping hands when the star forward was substituted along with most of his teammates with half an hour to go. It seemed meant to deliver a message of unity between the player and manager amid one of the most tumultuous periods in the club’s recent history. Girona offered little resistance to Barcelona’s attack, formed by new signing Francisco Trincão, Philippe Coutinho, Antoine Griezmann and Messi. Messi’s perfectly placed pass sent Trincão clear for the Portugal forward to square the ball to Coutinho, who only had to scoop in the 20th-minute opener. Messi doubled the lead in the 45th with a shot from outside the area that went in off the upright. Samuel Saiz got Girona on the scoreboard after halftime before Messi got his brace with a shot that took a deflection off a defender to fool the Girona goalkeeper.  ",sports
Draxler wins for PSG at the death,"  Julian Draxler’s header deep into stoppage time gave Paris Saint-Germain a 1-0 home win against Metz and spared the defending champion a fourth straight match without scoring. After losing the Champions League final 1-0 to Bayern Munich last month, PSG opened its league campaign with a 1-0 defeat at Lens followed by a 1-0 loss at home to Marseille on Sunday in which three PSG players were sent off. PSG finished this game with nine men after center half Abdou Diallo was red carded for a second yellow midway through the second half and left back Juan Bernat limped off injured near the end. After missing a host of chances, another embarrassing setback looked likely for PSG until Metz goalkeeper Alexandre Oukidja failed to properly clear Angel Di Maria’s cross from the left. The opportunist Draxler headed home in the 93rd minute to save coach Thomas Tuchel from more pressure. “We had chances to score in the first half, but we missed all of our good chances,” Tuchel said. Key midfielder Marco Verratti was sidelined with a minor injury, while striker Kylian Mbappé was also absent as he continues his recovery from the coronavirus. Mbappé could return for Sunday’s difficult match away to coach Patrick Vieira’s Nice. PSG was also missing Neymar, left back Layvin Kurzawa and midfielder Leandro Paredes against Metz. They were suspended after being sent off following a stoppage-time brawl against Marseille. Neymar claims he was racially abused during the game by Marseille defender Álvaro González. But the league’s disciplinary commission said on Wednesday night that so far there is not enough evidence to summon the players for a hearing. The disciplinary commission suspended Kurzawa for six games, while Neymar and Paredes each got a three-game ban plus one game suspended.    ",sports
"ICC Rankings: Virat maintains pole position in ODI chart, Bairstow enters top-10","  India captain Virat Kohli maintained the top rank in the ICC ODI rankings for batsmen while Englishman Jonny Bairstow broke into the top-10 following a string of good performances against Australia in the just concluded white ball series. Kohli (871 points) and his deputy Rohit Sharma (855 points, ranked two) are out of action for some time due to COVID-19 forced break but they have kept intact their positions. Bairstow topped the series aggregate with 196 runs after his 126-ball 112 in the final match to re-enter the top 10. The previous best for the 30-year-old Yorkshire player was ninth position in October 2018. He is now within 23 points of his career-best rating points of 777. Glenn Maxwell and Alex Carey after their hundreds in a series-winning cause also made gains in the ranking charts. Maxwell has gained five places to take joint 26th position along with Paul Stirling of Ireland after scoring 186 runs in the series, while Carey comes in next after his total of 152 runs elevated him 11 places to a career-best 28th position. England all-rounder Chris Woakes is a major gainer in the rankings for bowlers, advancing three places to a career-best fourth position after finishing with six wickets in the series. New Zealand's Trent Boult and India's Jasprit Bumrah are current occupying the top two slots. Woakes is also second in the list of all-rounders after also notching 89 runs in the series. His compatriot Ben Stokes is among those he has overtaken to reach within 20 points of Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi. Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has returned to the top 10 for the first time in nearly two years, his player of the match performance of 3/34 in the first match the highlight of a four-wicket tally. He has moved up from 15th to eighth position. Five-time World champions Australia collected 20 points from their first series of the Super League, introduced to add context to bilateral ODI series. The top seven teams from the Super League and hosts India book direct spots for the 2023 World Cup. England lead the points table but are the only team to have played two series, winning 2-1 at home against Ireland early on in the championship. India manage to hold onto their second position.

"Even with Leonard and George, Clippers stall in playoffs","  The more things changed for the Los Angeles Clippers, the more they stayed the same. They shocked the league by adding superstars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to a proven cast, immediately creating major expectations for the franchise to win its first NBA championship. In the end, the Clippers reverted to their old selves. They blew a 3-2 series lead and double-digit leads in multiple games against the Denver Nuggets, and got sent packing from the NBA playoff bubble. The franchise once mocked as the laughingstock of the NBA couldn't erase a big part of its ignominious history: 0-8 all time in games in which it could clinch a spot in the conference finals. We did have championship expectations. We had the talent to do it, Lou Williams said. ""I don't think we had the chemistry to do it and it showed."" George missed time to start the season while recovering from two offseason shoulder surgeries. Playing for his third team in three years, Leonard followed a load management program before the pandemic, rarely playing back-to-back games because of his left knee. The Clippers ran though numerous lineup changes and then the coronavirus pandemic hit, halting the season in March. Once the NBA resumed play in the bubble in Florida, the team lost players. Montrezl Harrell, the Sixth Man of the Year, missed 30 days; Patrick Beverley was out 16 days; Williams missed 14 days, including 10 in quarantine after visiting a strip club during an excused absence from the bubble. Some of that came back and haunted us, coach Doc Rivers said. But once you get to the playoffs, throw that all out the window and you've got to perform. You've got to perform better. You've got to execute better. You've got to trust better. You've got to play better as a team. It didn't happen, especially in Game 7. Leonard scored 14 points on 6 of 22 shooting; George scored 10 points on 4 of 16 shooting. The Clippers had just 33 points in the second half, and they didn't make a field goal in the fourth quarter until 4:58 was left in the game. George sees no need to tear up the roster. We like what we got, he said. The more we can be together, the better we'll be. It's year one."" Leonard owns two championship rings (San Antonio and Toronto) and Rivers has one (Boston). George joined Leonard in coming home to Los Angeles for a shot at his first in his 10th season in the league after years of futility in Indiana and Oklahoma City. Leonard and George are under contract for one more year; then each has an option for the 2021-22 season. After the game, fans took to the airwaves and social media to mourn or vent, with many calling for Rivers' job despite their personal affection for the veteran coach. He's guided teams to 3-1 leads in three series, and each time they've failed to advance. It happened to the Clippers against Houston in 2015, too. Rivers has taken the Clippers to the playoffs in six of his seven years with the team.   ",sports
Novak remains perfect,"  Djokovic extends unbeaten run on court, behaves better in 1st match since US Open default Novak Djokovic expressed his relief there was no “mental or emotional blockages or drama” as he swept past Italian wild card entry Salvatore Caruso into the Italian Open third round on Wednesday in his first match since his US Open default. “I was actually looking forward to get the official match as soon as possible after what happened in New York,” said the world No 1. Nine-time Rome winner Rafael Nadal also made his return to competition later on Wednesday after a six-month hiatus linked to the coronavirus pandemic. The number two seed beats fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, a recent semi-finalist at the US Open, 6-1, 6-1 for a place in the third round. The Serb was on his best behaviour after his dramatic last 16 disqualification on September 6 after he accidently struck a line judge with a ball hit in frustration. “I didn’t feel that I had any mental or emotional blockages or any dramas playing a match today,” he said. Djokovic, who had said he had learned a “big lesson” from his first ever disqualification, was keen to move on in Rome. The 33-year-old playfully greeted an imaginary crowd in an empty Central Court at the Foro Italico because of strict coronavirus measures. Only some noisy workers managed to unnerve the 17-time Grand Slam winner after missing break points. “It was very, very quiet, which is very unusual to what we are used to here in Rome, which has one of the loudest and most energetic crowd atmospheres on the tour. Djokovic continued where he left off before his US Open exit, having won the Cincinnati Masters on the same Flushing Meadows courts. “It was a very good test for me. I’m very pleased with the way I handled myself in important moments,” said Djokovic, who was unbeaten in 2020 before his US Open default. “I was in control of the match.” Djokovic, who has played nine finals in Rome, and won four titles, will meet 29th-ranked compatriot Filip Krajinovic who beat Italian qualifier Marco Cecchinato 6-4, 6-1, for a place in the quarter-finals. The number two seed plays fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, a recent semi-finalist at the US Open, for a place in the third round. Third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas fell to Italian teenager Jannik Sinner 6-1, 6-7 (9/11), 6-2, with sixth seeded Belgian David Goffin also exiting 6-2, 6-2 to Croatia’s Marin Cilic.   Halep, Azarenka advance Top women’s seed Simona Halep returned a month after winning in Prague to ease past 99th-ranked Italian Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 6-4. “It was a little bit difficult to get the rhythm and to get relaxed,” said the 28-year-old Romanian, who skipped the US Open but is warming up for a bid for a second French Open title. The world No 2, a two-time Rome finalist, next meets Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine who beat American Amanda Anisimova 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 . US Open finalist Victoria Azarenka shrugged off the move from hard court to the clay surface to beat Venus Williams 7-6 (9/7), 6-2, in their first round match. Belarusian Azarenka will play third seeded American Sofia Kenin, the reigning Australian Open champion, for a place in the third round. Swiss sixth seed Belinda Bencic fell 6-3, 6-1 in her second round match to Montenegro’s 86th-ranked Danka Kovinic.  ",sports
"The shape, mental space I'm in now, things will go well: Hardik","  Back from an lengthy injury layoff, Mumbai Indians' star all-rounder Hardik Pandya said the setback motivated him to work harder and he is now in good shape both physically and mentally for the IPL starting September 19. Pandya's form will be crucial for defending champions Mumbai Indians, who will take on Chennai Super Kings in the lung-opener of the cash-rich T20 league on September 19. ""The way I'm hitting the ball right now, the shape I'm in, the mental space I'm in, it is just a matter of time that I go and spend some time on the ground and I think things will come out pretty well,"" Pandya said in a video posted by Mumbai Indians' official Twitter handle. ""No matter how far I go from the game, no matter how long I stay out, when I come back, it has to be worth it. I have prepared very well and I think, great things are coming ahead,"" the 26-year-old flamboyant all-rounder added. Last year in November, Pandya had undergone a back surgery in London. He came back in the DY Patil T20 tournament held in early March. He was even selected for the ODI series against South Africa, but the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the rubber to be abandoned, delayed his return. He is now looking forward to the IPL. ""IPL is something that I have enjoyed a lot and I would like to make a comeback very strong and I'm just looking forward to it,"" said Pandya. He also conceded that injuries would be a part of his cricketing journey and motivate him to do better. ""In my life I have realised one thing that injuries would be with me. No one wants to get injured, but I accept the fact that what I do, injuries would be a part of it. ""Injuries have always kept me going, always kept me motivated. Actually taught me how much I have to put in the hard yards and the hard work has always increased, never decreased,"" said the Baroda all-rounder. Pandya also threw light on how he maintained his fitness during the lockdown. ""Luckily, me and (my brother) Krunal (Pandya) had the privilege to have a gym in our house. So because of that portion, we were able to work on our fitness...,"" he said. ""And I always feel that if you go one step ahead in your fitness, there are much more magical moments in your life (that) are waiting,"" the right-hander emphasised. Looking back at the DY Patil T20 Cup, which was his comeback tournament, Pandya, who has 1,068 runs from 66 IPL games, said it gave him confidence to implement his plans. ""Luckily, I got one tournament before, which was DY Patil, which I played for Reliance. And as a player, it gave me immense confidence to implement the hard work which I have done over a period of time and it just felt good,"" he signed off.

Power of 3,"  New German recruits make Blues debut in 3-1 away win against Brighton A Chelsea team featuring just two of its slew of high-profile and expensive signings got off to a winning start in the English Premier League by beating Brighton 3-1. Timo Werner and Kai Havertz - signed for a combined $160 million - didn’t manage to score at Amex Stadium, either, with Chelsea’s goals coming from Jorginho, Reece James and Kurt Zouma. James’ was the most spectacular and the most crucial, the right back’s swerving piledriver from 30 meters regaining the lead for Chelsea at 2-1 in the 56th minute, just two minutes after Brighton equalized through Leandro Trossard. Zouma’s deflected volley from a corner in the 66th then gave Chelsea some breathing space. “I thought we were OK,” Chelsea manager Frank Lampard said. “I liked the work ethic and discipline of the team. “We have been together for four days. ... To expect everything to click on day one would have been difficult.” While Havertz was fairly ineffective in his position on the right of midfield, fellow Germany international Werner - the lone striker - was more impressive and earned the penalty that was converted by Jorginho to break the deadlock in the 21st minute. Brighton midfielder Steven Alzate lost possession in central midfield as the hosts tried to play the ball out from the back, Werner was played through and was brought down by goalkeeper Mat Ryan. Jorginho sent Ryan the wrong way. Much-criticized goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was handed a start by Chelsea manager Frank Lampard but his failure to keep out Trossard's 54th-minute shot from outside the area will likely keep the scrutiny on him. Kepa seemed slow to get down as the ball squirmed beyond his outstretched right hand. James quickly put Chelsea back in front with a stunning strike that flew into the roof of the net, and the right back sent in the corner that Zouma met with a volley that ricocheted in off Brighton defender Adam Webster’s right foot. Of Chelsea’s other offseason signings that combined to cost $250 million, left back Ben Chilwell and playmaker Hakim Ziyech were injured and center back Thiago Silva wasn't ready after only recently joining up with the squad. “The players are still working each other out a little bit,” Lampard said. “Today we weren't as fluid as we could be .. I want us to have a lot more movement up front than we did today.”  ",sports
Fuming Paire shows little effort in 1st-round loss,"  Benoit Paire’s anger at being strictly confined at the U.S. Open after contracting the coronavirus boiled over at the Italian Open during a farcical first-round match. The 24th-ranked Paire threw his racket high into the air twice during one game and showed little effort against Italian teenager Jannik Sinner in a 6-2, 6-1 loss. Paire was forced to stay in isolation in New York until he tested negative — preventing him from training. The Frenchman criticized Rome organizers for making him play on the opening day of the tournament. “I made only one request, which is to play Tuesday to have an extra day of training after what happened to me in New York, and because I’m playing an Italian you put me on Monday,” Paire tweeted on Sunday. Twice during the second set, Paire launched his racket high into the air in frustration — the second time coming dangerously close to hitting the chair umpire. Paire, who put on a face mask during some of the changeovers, had numerous verbal exchanges with the chair umpire but received only one warning for his behavior. During the final game of the match, Paire slammed returns of serve into the net in anger — with seemingly no intent of putting the ball into play. When he finally managed to get a return into play on Sinner’s first match point, Paire seemed surprised and didn’t bother running down Sinner’s reply. “I had not played in 10 days, staying in my room,” Paire said. “It was a good training, I’m happy I played one hour. I even played one hour and four minutes. I’m happy I hung on for 1:04. I gave what I could. Jannik played very well. “The result does not really matter,” Paire added. “I still have the doubles. I will try to entertain myself with Nico (Nicolas Mahut) and try to win a match.” The tournament at the Foro Italico, where spectators are barred, was rescheduled from its usual May slot due to the pandemic. Sinner said, “On one hand I can understand, after spending so many days under quarantine in New York. … In the end, I did what I needed to.” He moves on to meet third-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. Kei Nishikori — who is returning from right elbow surgery and missed the U.S. Open after testing positive for COVID-19 — won for the first time in more than a year, beating Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-4, 7-6 (3). Also in the first round, Casper Ruud of Norway rallied past Karen Khachanov 6-3, 3-6, 6-1; Borna Coric beat Cristian Garin 6-4, 6-4; Grigor Dimitrov eliminated wild card Gianluca Mager 7-5, 6-1; and Filip Krajinovic beat Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-5.

DC has firepower to go all the way: Axar,"  Delhi Capitals all-rounder Axar Patel on Tuesday said he has “ticked all the boxes” in every department and reckoned the franchise has the firepower this time to win the IPL title, which has so far eluded them. Moved out of India due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, the 13th edition of the world’s biggest T20 league will be held in the three venues of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah in the UAE from September 19 to November 10. Delhi Capitals will enter the tournament as one of the top contenders. Commenting on the team that comprises some fine players, Axar said, “With the new changes, I think the squad looks good. With fast bowlers, spinners and all-rounders, we have covered all the bases and I think we can become champions this time. “Everyone looks positive in the nets and we all are in good shape.” The 26-year-old left-arm spinner, who is slowly adapting to the new normal amid the pandemic, spoke about the challenges that lay ahead and the experience of training while staying in a bio-bubble. “Obviously, with no crowd, we’ll feel empty. Then, the saliva ban is going to make a big difference for the bowlers. “During initial practice sessions, I was being conscious of not using saliva or sweat on the ball. So, these are the challenges which we will have to be wary of. “Nevertheless, the positive thing is that at least we will have action-packed cricket after a long time, which is a good thing for not only us, but also for India. Everyone will enjoy the game with a different frame of mind which will be really exciting,” he said. As part of the guidelines framed by the BCCI, the players and support staff will be tested every five days throughout the league. ""We are feeling a little bad that we can’t enjoy the matches with our friends. After every two days, tests are being conducted. “We can’t go out anywhere and we can’t sit for more than 15 minutes in anyone's room, so these things are challenging, but slowly we are getting used to it.”  ",sports
Murray gets French Open wildcard,"  Andy Murray received a wild card into the French Open. The former No. 1 was the only non-Frenchman of eight players to be given a free pass into the main draw of the clay grand slam which starts in 13 days. Murray was also awarded a wild card into the U.S. Open, after his struggles with pelvic and shin injuries dropped his ranking to 129th. He went two rounds in New York, and improved to 110th, but still too low for the French Open when it published its main draw entry list. Murray’s best French Open result was the final in 2016. Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria and Eugenie Bouchard of Canada were the only non-Frenchwomen to receive wild cards. Pironkova, who made the U.S. Open her first comeback tournament since 2017 after having a son, achieved an impressive first-time run to the quarterfinals, where she was stopped by Serena Williams. Pironkova’s best result at Roland Garros was the quarterfinals in 2016. Bouchard reached her first final in more than four years in Istanbul on Sunday and lost in a third-set tiebreaker. She lost to eventual champion Maria Sharapova in the French Open semifinals in 2014, the same year she reached the Wimbledon final.    ",sports
COVID-19 episode made me mentally stronger: Manpreet,"  India hockey skipper Manpreet Singh says going through a stressful isolation period while recovery from coronavirus has made him a mentally strong player who is now equipped to tackle any situation on the field. Manpreet was one of the six hockey players to test positive for COVID-19 at the team’s training base in Bengaluru last month after they arrived for the national camp. Having started their individual sessions after recovering, Manpreet said they still miss being part of the rest of the squad, even though Hockey India, Sports Authority of India and support staffs are doing their best to keep them upbeat. “Hockey India officials would check on us almost every day if the food being provided is good, if our tele-treatment was done regularly, if we are monitoring our oxygen levels regularly and so on. “Coaching Staff and teammates too would check on us through video calls. These things really helped us remain upbeat. Though it did sting a little to know all our teammates were back on the pitch while we were still in isolation, I feel this experience has made me mentally tougher to face any situation,” the skipper said. Recollecting the time spent at the hospital, the star midfielder said it was mentally tough for him and rest of the infected players to remain in isolation. “It was not easy, especially mentally. I have not done anything for a month and that's a long time in a sportsperson’s career especially when every day is about improving and being the best,” Manpreet said. “To be honest, initially when the results came out, we were slightly stressed. (But)  we received best facilities in the hospital with SAI constantly checking with the medical team there of our well-being.”  ",sports
McDonald says not sure about Stokes availability,"  Rajasthan Royals head coach Andew McDonald says the franchise is ""not sure"" about the availability of star all-rounder Ben Stokes in the upcoming IPL as he is tending to his ailing father in New Zealand. Stokes, hero of England's World Cup triumph last year, is going through a tough phase. He pulled out of the three-match series against Pakistan in August before the second Test to be with his father, diagnosed with brain cancer. “First and foremost, thoughts with the Stokes family. It’s a difficult scenario, so we're giving him as much time as he needs, and connecting with him as best we can,” McDonald was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo. “So yeah, we're not sure where Stokesy's at right now, but once it has played out, then we can make our decisions from there. But I don’t want to second-guess what will happen with him just yet.” Since the first Test against Pakistan, the top all-rounder has not played any cricket. Instead, he travelled to New Zealand, where his parents are settled. Stokes’ father Ged, a former New Zealand rugby league international, was admitted to hospital in Johannesburg two days before Christmas last year with a serious illness.  ",sports
Adjusting to UAE conditions will be biggest challenge: Boult,"  Dubai: Set to lead four-time champions Mumbai Indians bowling attack in absence of Lasith Malinga, Kiwi left-arm pacer Trent Boult believes the biggest challenge for all the teams in the 13th IPL will be to adjust to the hot and humid UAE conditions. “The biggest challenge so far has been trying to prepare to come to 45 degrees in the middle of the desert.

Neymar sees red in PSG defeat,"  Neymar was among five players sent off in stoppage time as Marseille beat bitter rival Paris Saint-Germain for the first time in nine years. PSG star Neymar got a straight red in Marseille’s 1-0 win following an altercation with center half Alvaro Gonzalez on Sunday. Neymar was sent off following a video replay showing he aimed a jab to the back of Gonzalez’s head. As he went off, Neymar told officials that he had been racially abused. “It’s a serious wrongdoing if that’s the case but I don’t think so,” Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas said. “What we saw, what was visible, is that (Angel) Di Maria spat (on Gonzalez).” With apparent reference to Gonzalez, Neymar later tweeted “The only regret I have is not hitting the face of this idiot.” In a later tweet, Neymar said “It’s easy for VAR to show my ‘aggression’. ‘Now I’d like to them to show the image of the racist who called me a ‘MONKEY SON OF A BITCH’. I’d really like that!” Winger Florian Thauvin scored in the 31st minute of a tense game featuring more than a dozen yellow cards and which descended into chaos deep into stoppage time as punches and kicks were exchanged. It was Marseille’s first victory over PSG since a 3-0 home win in November 2011. PSG has now lost three straight games 1-0, including the Champions League final against Bayern Munich on Aug 23 and away to promoted Lens last Thursday. PSG lost its opening two league games for the first time since the 1984-85 season and Tuchel may find himself under early pressure. The game ended with PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa and Marseille counterpart Jordan Amavi sent off for fighting in the seventh minute of injury time at Parc des Princes. PSG’s Leandro Paredes and Marseille’s Dario Benedetto soon followed before Neymar’s expulsion.  ",sports
Victorian Govt working on getting crowd back for Boxing Day Test & Aus Open,"  Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews on Monday said his Government is negotiating with Cricket Australia and Tennis Australia to have crowd attendance for the city’s iconic sports events — Boxing Day Test involving India and the Australian Open. There is speculation that MCG may miss out on hosting the Boxing Day Test, an annual highlight on the calendar, since Victoria is reeling under Covid-19 pandemic. Victoria, which is in lockdown since July, has accounted for 75 percent of cases and 90 percent of Covid deaths in the country. Australia have reported more than 26000 cases and more than 800 deaths. “We just have to work out what a safe crowd would be. It is too hard to say now what that number is,” Andrews said in a daily news briefing. “It is too early for us to determine how big any crowd might be. We will get as many people we can get there, provided it is safe.” More than eight lakh people thronged Melbourne Park for the Australian Open in January and more than two lakh attended the Boxing Day Test between Australia and New Zealand. With Melbourne looking a dicey venue, Adelaide is seen as the front-runner for the Boxing Day Test against India. “We don’t want one event to necessarily set us back and cause us a problem. It is hard for us to predict where virus numbers will be, what risks do we have to deal with in just a few weeks time, let alone months,” said Andrews.  ",sports
Tough one to get your head around: Cummins on loss in second ODI,"  Australia pacer Pat Cummins says the 24-run loss to England in the second ODI here was ""tough one to get your head around"" with his team letting the hosts off the hook twice in the game. From 149 for eight, England went on to make 231 for nine on a surface where runs were hard to come by. Australia then made a good start before a dramatic collapse saw them slip from 144 for two in the run chase to be 207 all-out. The three-match series is now levelled at 1-1. ""I'll get my head around that tomorrow and have a bit of a look at the footage. On that wicket, for 40 overs it felt like a good length was the hardest to hit, and suddenly they started hitting them quite nicely,"" said Cummins after the game on Sunday. ""We'll have a review. If we'd kept them down - those last 10 (overs) went for 80-odd, I think - we're suddenly only chasing 200 and it's a different game. ""It's a tough one to get your head around. I thought we bowled really well and then let them off the hook in the last 10 overs ... we gave them an extra 40 or 50 runs."" It was a slow surface which helped the spinners and Cummins said his team will have to improve its game on pitches like these, something it will encounter in the 2023 World Cup in India. ""Something we always talk about in tournament play and World Cups is that towards the back end, you are likely to get these kind of wickets where spinners (will play a role) and you're not getting 350 that you might get at the start of the tournament,"" he said. ""On a really good wicket, in your death bowling you go to yorkers or slower balls or bouncers. Here it's tossing up what's the hardest ball to hit - is it a yorker or maybe it's top of the stumps? ""Maybe you can keep the fields in for longer, the spinners might have more of an impact. I really enjoy it. It makes you think differently and try and solve problems,"" he said.   ",sports
"Sharma finishes 44th, Coetzee wins fifth European Tour title","  Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma once again allowed his gains to go waste with a bunch of bogeys as he carded an even par 71 in the final round to finish Tied-44th at the Portugal Masters here. The 24-year-old Indian, going through one of the worst patches of his professional career, had four birdies, three of them in four holes between 11th and 14th, but gave them all away with four bogeys, two of which came on 16th and 17th holes. South African George Coetzee displayed superb short game to card his third card of 66 in four days to hold off a strong chasing pack and win the 2020 Portugal Masters by two shots. It was his fifth European Tour title. Coetzee, who started the day with a one hole advantage, ended a winner by two as Laurie Canter (66) was second, while Tommy Fleetwood (64) gave himself a brilliant final round before leaving for the US Open next week. Fleetwood tied for third with Joakim Lagergren (65) and Japan's Masahiro Kawamura (70), who held sole lead at one point was fifth. Sharma, who has made only two cuts in seven starts since the Hero Open on the UK Swing, had no less than 14 birdies he had four or more birdies on second, third and final days, while the first day saw him land a rare albatross. But he also gave away 11 bogeys and two double bogeys. Coetzee, 34, made his first birdie of the day from 20 feet on the difficult seventh before picking up another shot from a similar distance on the short eighth to get to 13-under and regain his one stroke lead. After making another gain from nine feet at the 11th, Coetzee made key par putts on the 12th and 13th to remain in front as the chasing pack began to gather just behind him on an incredibly bunched leaderboard. He then holed brilliant birdie putts at the 16th and 17th to move to 16 under par and give himself a two shot cushion heading to the 18th tee. Coetzee saved his best drive until last and went on to make a nerveless par to win for the second week in a row, having also tasted victory at the Titleist Championship at Pretoria Country Club on the Sunshine Tour last week. Englishman Laurie Canter finished alone in second on 14-under after he also made five birdies in a flawless 66, while his countryman and World Number 16 Tommy Fleetwood was another stroke back in a tie for third with Swede Joakim Lagergren.

Is it safe to conduct Thomas and Uber Cup during corona times? asks Saina,"  Indian badminton star Saina Nehwal on Sunday raised concerns about the timing of next month's Thomas and Uber Cup, asking whether it would be safe to go ahead with it in the middle of a raging pandemic. Nehwal tweeted her apprehensions following the withdrawal of seven countries from the tournament due to the rising COVID-19 cases across the globe. ""7 countries have withdrawn from tournament cause of the pandemic...Is it safe enough to conduct this tournament during this time ??... (Thomas and Uber Cup 2020) #coronavirus,"" she tweeted. Scheduled to be held in Denmark from October 3 to 11, the Thomas and Uber Cup will mark the resumption of international badminton after it came to a halt in March because of the dreaded virus. Countries that have withdrawn include Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. India's build-up to the event has also been hit by the pandemic. A proposed preparatory camp in Hyderabad had to be cancelled after players refused to accept the quarantine conditions set by the Sports Authority of India (SAI). The Indian challenge will be spearheaded by reigning world champion PV Sindhu, who had pulled out initially citing personal reasons but was convinced to reverse her decision by the federation. However, world bronze-winner B Sai Praneeth has decided to give it a miss due to a knee injury. The Badminton World Federation, which has repeatedly rejigged the international calendar due to the pandemic, said participants at the tournament will not have to undergo quarantine after landing in Denmark if they had a negative COVID-19 test report.

"IPL can provide challenging practice to Indian, Aus players ahead of December duel: Chappell","  Former captain Ian Chappell believes playing cricket in COVID-19 era is a lot different from anything experienced in the past, but said the upcoming IPL can provide some ""challenging"" practice to Indian and Australian players ahead of their much-anticipated duel later this year. Indian players will fly directly to Australia after the IPL concludes on November 10 for the high-profile tour which is likely to begin with a T20 series followed by four Tests and ODIs. The IPL begins in Abu Dhabi on September 19. Chappell feels the high-profile T20 event might just be a blessing in disguise for the Indians and the Australians, with just a few series possible since mid-March because of the pandemic. ""One thing is certain: where there's a will, there's a way, and the better players are dedicated to finding a solution,"" Chappell wrote in a column for ESPNcricinfo.com.. ""In case of Indian players, and some of the Australians, they will at least have some challenging IPL cricket in the lead-up to the December series."" Chappell admitted the IPL ""may not seem like ideal preparation for a tough Test series in Australia"" but he recalled the thoughts of former England batsman Ravi Bopara in 2009. ""After a stint in the IPL, Bopara was asked on return to England if this was appropriate preparation for a Test match. He responded by saying that 'looking to score at every opportunity gets your feet moving positively'. He proved his point emphatically by scoring back-to-back centuries against West Indies."" The 76-year-old legend said with a host of health and safety protocols in place, it is difficult for visiting teams to prevail over home sides in the COVID-19 era. ""With venue bubbles, isolation rules, social distancing, and a number of changes to playing conditions, adapting to international competition has been testing for players. It's made life difficult and different even in a team environment but imagine the individual's dilemma in enforced isolation with a tour looming,"" he said. ""The physical preparation is not so difficult, especially for self-starters, but how do you stay in cricket shape?"" But the former captain said the Indians very well understand the stakes associated with the tour of Australia and will leave no stone unturned in their preparations for the series. ""The Indian players could well adopt this attitude for a series in Australia that will impact the Border-Gavaskar trophy, the World Test Championship, and their personal pride. ""It's unlikely India will have the luxury of lead-up matches against tough opposition. More likely it will be intra-squad games, which can be helpful if selection is judicious and pits good bowlers against equally talented batsmen. The downside is the fast bowlers are often wary of injuring their own players,"" he said.

"Naomi Osaka comes back, beats Azarenka for 2nd US Open title","  After one errant forehand in the first set of the US Open final, Naomi Osaka looked at her coach in the mostly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium stands with palms up, as if to say, ""What the heck is happening?"" In response to another wayward forehand against Victoria Azarenka seconds later, Osaka chucked her racket. It spun a bit and rattled against the court. Surprisingly off-kilter in the early going Saturday, Osaka kept missing shots and digging herself a deficit. Until, suddenly, she lifted her game, and Azarenka couldn't sustain her start. By the end, Osaka pulled away to a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory for her second US Open championship and third Grand Slam title overall. ""For me, I just thought,"" said Osaka, who trailed by a set and a break, ""it would be very embarrassing to lose this in an under an hour."" This, then, is what she told herself with a white towel draped over her head at a changeover when things looked bleakest: ""I just have to try as hard as I can and stop having a really bad attitude."" It worked. A quarter-century had passed since a woman who lost the first set of a US Open final wound up winning: In 1994, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario did it against Steffi Graf. ""I wasn't really thinking about winning. I was just thinking about competing,"" Osaka said. ""Somehow, I ended up with the trophy."" Osaka is a 22-year-old who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Haitian father; the family moved to the US when she was 3. Osaka, now based in California, arrived for the US Open intent on claiming the championship, to be sure, but with another goal in mind, as well: continuing to be a voice for change by calling attention to racial injustice. She showed up for Saturday's match wearing a mask with the name of Tamir Rice, a Black 12-year-old boy killed by police in Ohio in 2014. That was the seventh mask she'd used during the tournament, after honoring other Black victims of violence: Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, Trayvon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and Philando Castile. ""The point,"" Osaka explained, ""is to make people start talking."" Last month, Osaka refused to compete after the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in Wisconsin she said she would withdraw from her semifinal at the Western & Southern Open, although decided to play after the tournament took a full day off in solidarity. Osaka and her coach, Wim Fissette who used to work with Azarenka have said they think the off-court activism has helped her energy and mindset in matches. ""I wanted,"" Osaka said, ""more people to (see) more names."" So perhaps it was no coincidence that this win over Azarenka, a 31-year-old from Belarus also seeking a third Grand Slam title but first in 7 years, made Osaka 11-0 since tennis resumed after its hiatus because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Osaka added to her triumphs at the 2018 US Open earned with a brilliant performance in a memorably chaotic and controversial final against Serena Williams and 2019 Australian Open. Azarenka carried an 11-match winning streak of her own into Saturday, including a stirring three-set victory over Williams in the semifinals, stopping the American's bid for a 24th Grand Slam title. Azarenka won the 2012 and 2013 Australian Opens and lost to Williams in the US Open finals each of those years. ""I thought the third time was the charm,"" Azarenka said, ""but I guess I'll have to try again."" Even after Osaka surged ahead 4-1 in the third set, the outcome was unclear. Azarenka drew to 4-3, then stood and stretched during the ensuing changeover. ""Had a little bit of a energy dip,"" Azarenka said. Osaka regained control, then laid down on the court when the final was over. The 23,000-plus seats in the main arena at Flushing Meadows were not entirely unclaimed, just mostly so while fans were not allowed to attend because of the coronavirus pandemic, dozens of people who worked at the tournament attended and the cavernous place was not entirely silent, just mostly so. One of the lucky few in the house: Osaka's boyfriend, rapper YBN Cordae. ""I'm very grateful for the opportunity to play in front of millions of people watching on TV,"" Azarenka said. ""Unfortunately, they're not here."" Certainly no thunderous applause or the cacophony of yells that normally would reverberate over and over and over again through the course of a Grand Slam final, accompanying the players' introductions or preceding the first point or after the greatest of shots. Instead, a polite smattering of claps from several hands marked such moments. Azarenka led early thanks to terrific returning and let-no-ball-by defense, stretching points until Osaka missed. And she repeatedly missed; the first set was over in a blink. Azarenka broke early in the second set, too, to lead 2-0. The question shifted from ""Who will win?"" to ""Might this be the most lopsided US Open final?"" Except Osaka made subtle changes that altered the match. She stepped closer to the baseline, redirecting shots more immediately and forcefully. Azarenka began hitting the ball less stridently, making mistakes she avoided earlier.  ",sports
"Mo Salah, more goals","  Egyptian’s last-minute penalty seals win for Premier League champions! Liverpool began the defence of the league title with 4-3 win in a thrilling game at Anfield. Mo Salah blasted the Reds into the lead from the penalty spot but Jack Harrison levelled things with a smart finish following a brilliant Kalvin Phillips cross-field pass. Virgil van Dijk rose highest unmarked from an Andy Robertson corner to head Liverpool back into the lead. However, the Dutchman was at fault for Leeds’ equaliser as his poor clearance allowed Patrick Bamford to slide the ball past Alisson. Leeds couldn’t hang on again and after failing to clear Andy Robertson’s free-kick properly, Salah powered a shot into the top corner to restore Liverpool’s lead. Helder Costa’s pinpoint pass found Mateusz Klich in the area who brought the score level for a third time. It looked as if Leeds had come away with a stunning opening-day point before Rodrigo’s foul on Fabinho awarded the hosts their second penalty of the game. Salah made no mistake again to earn Liverpool the three points. willian stars Earlier in the first game of the new season, Arsenal made a flying start as Gabriel Magalhaes grabbed a debut goal and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a stunner in 3-0 win at Fulham. Arsenal’s free-flowing attack was too incisive for promoted Fulham and Alexandre Lacazette gave the visitors an early lead at Craven Cottage. Brazilian defender Gabriel scored Arsenal’s second after the break in his first appearance since his close-season move from Lille. Aubameyang added the final flourish with a typically eye-catching strike that emphasised why Arsenal are so desperate for the Gabon forward to sign an extension to the contract which expires at the end of the season. Arteta has said that fans concerned Aubameyang will leave can “relax” because he is “very optimistic” his captain will agree a new deal soon. With former Chelsea winger Willian providing a pair of assists on his debut, it was the ideal way for Arsenal to start a season that appears full of promise after last season’s FA Cup triumph.  Although their eighth-placed finish in the Premier League ranked as Arsenal’s lowest final position since 1995, Arteta had little to do with that after taking charge in December following the dismal reign of Unai Emery. The former Manchester City assistant coach has been a much-needed breath of fresh air for Arsenal and pushing for a place in the top four should not be beyond his revitalised team this term. While the continued absence of fans due to the coronavirus and shorter than usual break has taken a little anticipation away from the new campaign, Arsenal were keener than most to get back in action after beating Chelsea in the FA Cup final. The Gunners had underlined their rapid improvement by defeating Premier League champions Liverpool on penalties in the Community Shield last month and Fulham were no match for them.  Crumbling Fulham The only dark cloud for Arteta was a pre-match spat between Dani Ceballos and Eddie Nketiah. The pair had to be separated by Arsenal team-mates after Nketiah reacted to an aggressive challenge from Ceballos while a group of players were exchanging passes in the warm-up. Arteta must have been alarmed when Ainsley Maitland-Niles hit a weak back pass that caused confusion between Gabriel and recalled keeper Bernd Leno early on. Aboubakar Kamara nipped in but Leno managed to save at his feet before the Fulham forward could get a shot away. Arteta’s worries were eased when Lacazette netted in the ninth minute. Granit Xkaha’s strike forced a miscued clearance from Tim Ream and Willian pounced with a close-range shot that Fulham keeper Marek Rodak could only push out to Lacazette, who slotted home from virtually on the goalline.  It made Lacazette the first player to score the opening goal of a Premier League campaign twice after the French striker also bagged the opener in 2017-18. Willian was denied a debut goal when his low free-kick cannoned off the base of the post. Gabriel was enjoying a composed debut and the 22-year-old showed he can be a goal threat as well when he doubled Arsenal's lead in the 49th minute. Willian swung over the corner and Gabriel showed his desire as he rose above Michael Hector for an attempted header that hit his shoulder as it flashed into the net. Fulham’s defence was crumbling like the recently demolished Craven Cottage stand and Aubameyang finished them off in the 57th minute with a carbon copy of his Community Shield goal against Liverpool. Just as at Wembley, Willian’s superb cross-field pass picked out Aubameyang and he was allowed to advance unchecked into the area before bending a fine finish into the far corner.  ",sports

IPL will set momentum for Down Under: Shami,"  The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the right kind of tournament that allows players to get into the groove nicely, an absolute must before they hit the Australian shores for two and half months, feels Indian team’s premier speedster Mohammed Shami. The Australia-bound India players will fly directly after the IPL concludes on November 10 for the much-anticipated tour which is likely to begin with a T20 series followed by four Tests and ODIs. “It would be great that the Australia-bound players are playing IPL. It will set the body and momentum perfectly by then,” the Kings XI pace spearhead said. India under Virat Kohli achieved the historic feat of winning in Australia for the first time in 2018-19 but the hosts did not have Steve Smith and David Warner back then because of their involvement in the ball tampering scandal. The duo’s presence would make the series even more exciting and Shami said everyone is focused on the tour as well. “I feel it’s better that we are playing IPL before a big series. Apart from IPL, everyone is also focused on that tour (Down Under). There is a lot of talk about that series. We will have a good contest.” With the IPL shifted to the UAE, the tournament will be held across three venues of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah, comprising 60 matches spread over 53 days. Shami feels unlike in India where they have to fly all over the country for away matches, the IPL in UAE would be less hectic this time. “Yes, there’re back to back matches, training, travelling that’s a bit of headache.

However, Smith has passed the two concussion tests, one on Friday and the other on Saturday, according to cricket.Com.Au. Left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc experienced some groin pain on Friday. He managed to complete his 10 overs after slipping on the field but is also expected to play on Sunday.          ",sports
Hazlewood stars in Oz win,"  Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood insisted it was a case of “onwards and upwards” after he starred in a 19-run win over world champions England in the first ODI at Old Trafford on Friday. Hazlewood took a miserly 3-26 from his maximum 10 overs that stifled England’s pursuit of a target of 295 from the outset, removing opener Jason Roy and Test skipper Joe Root for single figure scores as the hosts limped to 22-2 off the first 10 overs. This was Australia’s first 50-over match against England since a crushing eight-wicket defeat by their arch-rivals in the semi-finals of last year’s World Cup at Edgbaston. Hazlewood, however, didn’t play in that match after being controversially omitted from the World Cup squad, with the selectors instead wanting him to regain full fitness following a back injury for the subsequent Ashes in England. Asked if the way he bowled on Friday made his World Cup absence all the more painful, Hazlewood replied: “Nah it’s onwards and upwards. That’s a long time ago now, so always looking forward.” The 29-year-old was close to unplayable during a stunning opening spell of two wickets for five runs in six overs. “England’s top order is probably the form top order in the world in the last three or four years, so I guess going against them is a good measure of where you’re at,” Hazlewood said after what was just Australia’s third win in 14 ODIs against their oldest foe. “To keep them down to 20-odd for two in the first 10 was great.” Meanwhile England captain Eoin Morgan said Hazlewood had enjoyed a “day out” after his side went 1-0 down in a three-match series that continues on Sunday. “They (Australia) were outstanding, incredibly accurate and they got the ball moving,” he said. “It’s not often it happens to us.” ‘Keeping Stokesy’s chair warm’ Sam Billings kept England in the game with 118, his maiden ODI hundred, after sharing a century partnership with Jonny Bairstow (84) following the hosts’ collapse to 57-4. Billings was the only member of England’s XI on Friday not involved in the World Cup squad, with his inclusion owing much to star all-rounder Ben Stokes still being on compassionate leave with his ill father. Billings, reflecting on his “mixed feelings” at making a hundred in a losing cause, told Sky Sports he was keen to “keep putting scores on the board” after what was just his 19th ODI appearance in a five-year England career. The 29-year-old Kent batsman added, however: “I don’t think it matters how many runs I get, I know I’m only keeping Stokesy’s chair warm for him.” Morgan, however, insisted Billings had batted brilliantly on the back of “sporadic” chances caused by the fact he, as well as Jos Buttler and Stokes, had often been at No 6 instead. “But today he (Billings) really stood out in a spot that is really difficult to bat, where you can be thrown in at all different circumstances,” said Morgan.

"Zvonareva, Siegemund win women’s doubles","  Vera Zvonareva and Laura Siegemund stood awkwardly facing each other, rackets and arms in the air in confusion. Finally, Siegemund turned to the chair umpire for a ruling. “Are we allowed to give a hug?” she asked. The rules of tennis during the coronavirus pandemic were the only thing Zvonareva and Siegemund couldn’t figure out in their first tournament together. The duo won the US Open women’s doubles title on Friday, beating the third-seeded team of Xu Yifan and Nicole Melichar 6-4, 6-4. Zvonareva and Siegemund collected $400,000 — and also their hug — by racing to quick leads in both sets and holding on when their opponents began to play better. Unseeded after deciding to play together shortly before the tournament, Zvonareva and Siegemund found their games worked together and plan to partner again at the upcoming French Open. “I felt like the third match we really started communicating well, we really started to understand each other,” Zvonareva said. “Yeah, it just got better and better from there on.” Zvonareva, a Russian who turned 36 this week, added this title to the 2006 US Open trophy she won with Nathalie Dechy. She also was the runner-up in singles at Flushing Meadows in 2010, falling to Kim Clijsters, and rose to a career-high singles ranking of No 2 the following month. She also won the 2012 Australian Open doubles title but later battled injuries and began playing less, especially after giving birth to daughter Evelina in 2016. As for Xu and Melichar, they finished second for the second straight tournament in New York. The pair was runners-up at the Western & Southern Open that’s usually played in Ohio.        ",sports
"5 sets, two fighters, one winner","  For two full sets, Alexander Zverev was confused and listless, his body language as poor as his winner-to-error ratio against Pablo Carreño Busta in the US Open semifinals on Friday. Zverev double-faulted and smacked his left high. He put a backhand into the net to cede the opening set and covered his face with both hands. He netted a forehand early in the next set, then turned a forlorn face toward his guest box and put his palms up. When he pushed a backhand long after 1 hour, 25 minutes of play and shook his head, Zverev trailed by two sets, a deficit the 23-year-old German never had overcome. Never had been to a Grand Slam final, either. Done and done. Zverev constructed quite a comeback, getting his game in gear to beat a fading Carreño Busta 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 and reach the title match at Flushing Meadows. Zverev, the No 5 seed, will play No 2 seed Dominic Thiem on Sunday, and one will walk away with his first Grand Slam trophy in a mostly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium; spectators were barred because of the coronavirus pandemic . “Mentally, I stayed in it. ... A lot of players would have gone away,” Zverev said. ""There’s no easy matches anymore. Sometimes you have to dig deep. Today I dug deep, dug very deep.” Thiem, a 27-year-old from Austria, won a far more entertaining match on Friday night, holding off 2019 US Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (5). Medvedev held a set point in both the second and third, but Thiem hung in there both times and now will try to improve his 0-3 record in Grand Slam finals. He has lost to Rafael Nadal at the French Open the past two years and to Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open this February. “I love these big matches — even more when there’s a full stadium, but it’s also great in front of many, many TV spectators,” Thiem said. “To face the best guys in the world, that’s what I do the hard work for all the time at home and in the offseason.” The No 3-seeded Medvedev hadn’t dropped a set all tournament until facing Thiem. He’d been broken just three times, a total Thiem matched by Friday’s second set. After conceding first set, Medvedev went up an early break in the second and was two points from taking it while ahead 5-3 and Thiem serving at love-30, but couldn’t came through. Medvedev held a set point at 6-5 in the tiebreaker and faltered again, even though Thiem felt something in his right heel while chasing a drop shot. Thiem began limping and wincing and was worked on by a trainer before the third set. His team also sent him some fresh shoes, but after he slipped behind the baseline on one point, Thiem shouted in German, clearly miffed. After the match, Thiem said he was pain-free. Medvedev was a point away from taking the third set at 5-3, 40-30, but framed a forehand. “I lost the most important points,” Medvedev lamented, “and that’s how he got the win.” Zverev is the first man to win a US Open semifinal after a 2-0 set deficit since Djokovic did it against Roger Federer in 2011 — and, keeping good company, he’s also the youngest male finalist at any major tournament since Djokovic was 23 in New York in 2010. Zverev’s first trip to a major semifinal came in January at the Australian Open, where he was eliminated by Thiem, who leads their head-to-head series 7-2. “A great friendship, a great rivalry,” Thiem said. A day after a pair of well-played and competitive women’s semifinals — won by Naomi Osaka and Victoria Azarenka, who face each other Saturday night for the championship — Carreño Busta vs Zverev offered little in the way of those characteristics for two sets. “A big opportunity,” the 20th-seeded Carreño Busta called it. Zverev simply kept missing the mark, even on neutral balls. Yet after totaling 25 winners and 36 unforced errors over the first two sets, Zverev had 46 winners and just 21 unforced errors over the last three. “I started taking the ball much earlier. I started taking the ball more on the rise. I started giving myself the chance to be the one that is aggressive,” Zverev explained. “I think in the first few sets, Pablo was the one dictating much more than I did. This is how the match slowly turned around.” Undeterred when Carreño Busta twice hit balls right at him during points in the fourth set, Zverev could throw his head back and allow himself a wide smile at the end.

Klopp unhappy with removal of five-sub rule,"  Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp branded the decision to not extend the use of five substitutes in the Premier League as a lack of common sense as he voiced his concerns for player welfare in a congested season. The Reds begin the defence of their Premier League title at home to Leeds on Saturday in a campaign that is starting a month later than normal due to the three-month halt to last season caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Both domestic cup competitions in England have been retained, while Liverpool are among the clubs who will face six Champions League group games in seven weeks between late October and early December. Despite the fixture pile up, the Premier League has not followed the example of other major European leagues in extending a temporary rule after the resumption of last season that allowed matchday squads to increase from 18 to 20 and managers to make five substitutions instead of three. “We press a normal season into a shorter period which will be a proper challenge, especially with the wonderful rule we set up with 18 (players) and three (substitutes),” Klopp said on Friday. “It’s only about player welfare, nothing else, but I don’t know why we have to discuss it at all and not everybody says yes of course, like the whole world is doing, at least the whole of Europe!” Two votes on the rule found a majority of Premier League clubs were against the rule being extended with those nearer the bottom of the table fearing it gave the bigger clubs with better squads an even greater advantage. “I thought from a common sense point of view that for this year, only this year not forever, that we would have 20 and five,” added Klopp. “What I really don’t like is that we deal with this thing based on the wrong facts. “It is not about having advantages, it is about player welfare and about having the highest quality in the games for all teams. I was really surprised when I heard the league decided against it.”  ",sports

Naomi has done it again,"  Helped by net, bad call, she beats Brady to reach her second US final It wasn’t until Naomi Osaka got a little help from a fortunate net-cord and an incorrect line call that she finally was able to get the better of Jennifer Brady in a US Open semifinal filled with fast serves and strong forehands. And now Osaka, still just 22, is one victory away from a third Grand Slam title. Osaka finally surged ahead midway through the last set with the only service break she would get on Thursday night — and only she would need — to beat Brady 7-6 (1), 3-6, 6-3, returning to the final at Flushing Meadows two years after winning the championship. “It means a lot for me. I kind of consider New York my second home,” said Osaka, who was born in Japan and moved to the United States as a child. “I kind of love the atmosphere, even though there’s no people here. I feel like this court kind of suits me well.” Suited both players just fine for most of the high-quality semifinal. Osaka served at up to 120 mph; Brady reached 117 mph. And they pounded the ball once it was in play, too, particularly off the forehand side. “I just felt like I was sticking it out. It felt like we were trading serves,” Osaka said. “I tried to adjust a little bit on her serve in the third set so maybe that helped.” They combined for 70 winners — 35 apiece — to just 42 unforced errors, each as good as the other, and it took a bit of luck to swing things after 1 hour, 45 minutes. That’s when, at 2-1 in the third set, Osaka earned her first break point with a backhand that clipped the net tape and trickled over. She was able to convert the chance when she hit a deep return of a 110 mph serve, and Brady’s backhand in response was called long — although a television replay showed it actually caught a piece of the back of the baseline. Brady did not challenge the ruling. Ashe is one of only two courts at the US Open using line judges this year; to reduce the number of people on site, the tournament used electronic line-calling in the other arenas.  ",sports

"Sharma lands rare albatross, but cards 73, lies 93rd in Spain","  A rare albatross on the penultimate hole of the opening round brought Indian golfer Shunhankar Sharma to par in one swoop but the double bogey on the last one spoilt the effort at the 2020 Portugal Masters. Sharma experienced ecstasy and agony on successive holes as he closed with two-over 73 to lie at Tied-93 on Thursday. Sharma, who is going through a lean patch, opened the round late in the afternoon with a bogey on Par-4 first. He got his first birdie on the fourth, but a double bogey on the seventh saw him turn in 2-over 37. On the back nine a bogey on 11th pushed him further down to 3-over. As the round came closer to the end, Sharma's 2-Iron from 241 yards on the 588 yard par 17th hole found its way into the cup for a rare albatross. It was the first albatross on the 2020 Race to Dubai. But he finished with his second double bogey of the day on 18th for a 74. Last year at the Memorial on PGA Tour, Sharma had a similar albatross in the second round. Liam Johnston produced the lowest round of his European Tour career at Dom Pedro Victoria Golf Course, firing a sparkling round of 61 to lead by one shot at the end of the opening day. At nine under par through 16 holes the Scot was in contention to match the historic 59 Oliver Fisher shot here two years ago. England's Laurie Canter is at seven under par after a round of 64, as all of the leading three players went bogey-free in Vilamoura. Northern Ireland's Jonathan Caldwell is at six under par, one shot ahead of South African George Coetzee, England's Matthew Jordan, Dane Thorbj rn Olesen and Sebastian Soderberg of Sweden. A group of 12 players are then at four under par, with World Number 16 Tommy Fleetwood and the highest-placed Portuguese player Tom s Bessa amongst a further eight players at three under par.

Down but NEVER out,"  Serena rallies to win second and third sets in convincing fashion over Pironkova They were just two particular points from Serena Williams’ latest three-set comeback at the US Open, yet they were pivotal and consisted of the sorts of lengthy exchanges filled with athleticism and brilliance that in any other, non-pandemic year would be marked by thousands of folks rising to their feet for delirious roars and raucous applause. She needed both of these points, one of which included a shot she hit left-handed, to reverse a deficit that reached the scale of a set and a break after 45 minutes of her quarterfinal against Tsvetana Pironkova on a cloudy Wednesday in empty Arthur Ashe Stadium. Williams needed both of these points during a five-game, match-altering run — along with 20 aces, her most in a match in eight years — to end up on the right side of a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 score after more than two hours to get to the semifinals at Flushing Meadows for an 11th consecutive appearance. “It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish, right?” Williams said. Two more victories would allow her to claim a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title. “In the beginning, I was a little fatigued, for whatever reason,” Williams said.      “Obviously, I can’t do that if I want to keep winning, so I need to figure that out.” How big an upset would this have been if Pironkova had held on? Not only is she not seeded at Flushing Meadows, she doesn’t even appear in the WTA rankings at all — this was her first tournament of any sort in more than three years, because she left the tour to become a mother. “It’s unbelievable,” Williams said about Pironkova’s impressive return to competition. “Wow. I couldn’t even do that.” When the players stepped out onto the court, the stadium announcer — announcing for whom, exactly, was something of a mystery — referred to Pironkova, a 32-year-old from Bulgaria, as “Alexander’s mom” and then to Williams as “Olympia’s mom” during the pre-match introductions. “It just shows me how tough moms are,” Williams said afterward. “You play a match and you go home and you’re still changing diapers,” said Williams, whose daughter turned 3 on Sept 1 and is a little older than Pironkova’s son. “It’s like a double life. It’s really surreal.” The American, who turns 39 in less than three weeks, has won six US Open championships; she was the runner-up the past two years. Williams last lost before the semifinals in New York in 2007, when Justine Henin eliminated her in the quarterfinals. On Thursday, Williams will face Victoria Azarenka, who returned to the US Open semifinals for the first time since 2013 by overwhelming Elise Mertens 6-1, 6-0 on Wednesday night. Williams leads her head-to-head series against Azarenka 18-4, including beating her in the 2012 and 2013 finals in New York.

Vettel signs for Racing Point,"  Four-time Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel will drive for Racing Point starting next season. The team, which will be renamed Aston Martin, announced the move on Thursday, a day after driver Sergio Perez said he was on his way out. The team said Vettel has signed for the 2021 season “and beyond” but did not reveal the length of the contract. “The signing of Sebastian is a clear statement of the team’s ambition to establish itself as one of the most competitive names in the sport,” the team said in a statement. “As a four-time world champion, Sebastian brings a fresh mindset to the team.” One of the most successful drivers in F1, Vettel is leaving Ferrari at the end of this season after he was not offered a new contract. He will be replaced by McLaren driver Carlos Sainz at Ferrari next year. Vettel has won 53 grand prix races, a tally only surpassed by Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton. He won four consecutive titles with Red Bull from 2010-13 and joined Ferrari in 2015 with the aim to win another. But he never had a car really capable of challenging Mercedes during his stint with the Scuderia, where he lost his No 1 status as teammate Charles Leclerc came to prominence. “It’s a new adventure for me with a truly legendary car company,” Vettel said. “I have been impressed with the results the team has achieved this year and I believe the future looks even brighter. I still have so much love for Formula 1 and my only motivation is to race at the front of the grid.”  ",sports
Dominance personified,"  Not only had 2019 runner-up Daniil Medvedev not dropped a set in this US Open entering his all-Russian quarterfinal against long-time pal Andrey Rublev, but Medvedev hadn’t allowed more than four games in any set. So when Rublev grabbed a sizable lead in the opening-set tiebreaker on Wednesday and three times was a single point from closing it, the moment felt momentous. Turned out it was. The No 3-seeded Medvedev fought off that trio of chances for No 10 Rublev in the tiebreaker by reeling off five points in a row, and was on his way to a 7-6 (6), 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory to return to the semifinals at Flushing Meadows. The only concern for Medvedev in the latter stages was whether his body would hold up — he was dealing with cramps and needed his right shoulder massaged by a trainer in the third set — but he did, indeed, hold on. “It was tough at the end,” Medvedev said. It’s been 60 years since a man won this Grand Slam tournament without ceding a set; Neale Fraser did so in 1960 at the event then known as the US Championships. A year after losing to Rafael Nadal in a five-set final that lasted nearly five hours, Medvedev heads to his second career major semifinal. He will now face No 2 seed Dominic Thiem for the title showdown place, who bulldozed 21st seed Alex de Minaur 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 in just 2 hours 4 minutes.

Williams leads her head-to-head series against Azarenka 18-4, including beating her in the 2012 and 2013 finals in New York. It was in a 2012 match against Azarenka at Wimbledon that Williams last topped 20 aces, producing 24. The other women's semifinal Thursday will be 2018 champion Naomi Osaka vs. No. 28 seed Jennifer Brady. In the men's quarterfinals Wednesday, 2019 runner-up Daniil Medvedev beat No. 10 Andrey Rublev 7-6 (6), 6-3, 7-6 (5) to return to the final four, with No. 2 Dominic Thiem against No. 21 Alex de Minaur scheduled to meet at night. Medvedev hasn't dropped a set in the tournament. Williams also needed a comeback and the maximum number of sets to get through the fourth round before defeating 15th-seeded Maria Sakkari 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3. In Wednesday's turnaround, the first key moment involved 24 strokes, the next-to-last a cross-court forehand by Williams from wide of the doubles alley, and the last an on-the-run squash forehand by Pironkova that landed in the net. That gave Williams a break and a 5-3 edge in the second set. Williams raised her left fist as her husband yelled from his front-row corner seat; Pironkova put a hand on her knee, smiled ruefully and squatted behind the baseline. The other came in a four-deuce opening game of the final set, and began with the right-handed Williams taking a page out of old friend Maria Sharapova's playbook by hitting a left-handed return of serve. Another 15 strokes followed, with Williams smacking a forehand passing shot that Pironkova volleyed into the net tape. That was intense, Williams said. I was just trying to do everything I can whether righty or lefty. Pironkova dropped onto her back, chest heaving; she left so much sweat on the court that a ball person was beckoned to wipe it away with a towel. That afforded Williams a third break point, which was converted for a 1-0 lead when Pironkova sent a forehand long. She definitely played like the champion she is, Pironkova said. Williams then only added to the lead, her strokes finding targets better the longer the match went on. Her serve was especially good, as it usually is. In contrast, Pironkova began to have more trouble on the longer points that she dominated early; she won the first half-dozen that lasted 10 strokes or more before Williams found more success. A couple of times, Pironkova drew Williams forward with a drop shot, then took the point with a perfectly arced lob. I tried everything, Pironkova said. But after compiling only five unforced errors in the first set, Pironkova had 21 over the last two. Williams, in contrast, made 11 in the first set, just 13 the rest of the way. Definitely, the first set, I think I was in control of the match. I was doing all kinds of shots, and everything went ... my way, Pironkova said. But, you know, I was expecting (that) it's not going to last forever.   ",sports
Hazlewood hoping for ''enough red-ball cricket'' before first India Test,"  Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood is hoping to get enough game time in red-ball cricket before the first Test against India later this year and has expressed a desire to see the series opener being played in ""lucky"" Brisbane. India are scheduled to tour Australia for a four-match Test series later this year. Considering the situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said even a practice game against Australia A squad would work well with him. ""The summer is becoming a bit clearer as the days go by and I'm sure we'll get enough red-ball cricket before that first Test, whether it's Australia versus Australia A or something like that,"" he was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo. ""I'm quite happy with just one long-form game, I feel like that's enough for me to get up and running. That's what I've done last five or six years, one Shield game and straight into the Test matches."" Hazlewood admitted his teammates would ideally like to start the Test series in Brisbane, where Australia have not lost since 1988. ""Things are out of our control a bit at the moment. Obviously, we'd love to start in Brizzy with our great record there,"" he said. ""We play well there and sort of get on a role, but this year will be a lot different. We love playing in Adelaide whether it's red ball or pink and it's always a great wicket."" The series India won two years ago started in Adelaide, where the visitors won, and Brisbane was not among the venues. Hazlewood is among many Australian players, including fellow paceman Pat Cummins, who will head from the ongoing tour of England to the IPL, where he has a contract with Chennai Super Kings, before returning home in early or mid-November. The pacer, who played his first T20I in four years on Tuesday, said he has adjusted to the game's shortest format. ""I feel comfortable in the format, have been working on a few things and they seem to be going well."" he said. ""Hopefully I get a few games for Chennai this year and every time I get out there in T20 just keep taking the opportunity.""  ",sports
"CSK have experience and quality, I believe we have a great chance: Watson","  The experience and quality of Chennai Super Kings' battle-hardened players should see the team through in the upcoming IPL despite a turbulent build-up caused by 13 COVID-19 cases in the contingent, feels veteran all-rounder Shane Watson. The CSK unit was rocked by 13 cases of the dreaded disease barely weeks before the September 19 tournament-opener and the list also included two players. This resulted in an extended quarantine period and a delayed start to their outdoor training session. ""Having an experienced team means your players have more understanding of being able to get their skills to execute under pressure from game one,"" Watson said on Nabeel Hashmi's YouTube show. Hashmi is the head of player acquisitions at the Quetta Gladiators, Watson's team in the Pakistan Super League. The former Australian all-rounder added, ""That is why we believe we've got a great chance of having a great year because of the quality of players and the experience we've got. ""We've got more chance of not making many mistakes trying to get up to speed as quickly as we possibly can."" As one of T20 leagues' biggest freelancers, Watson has been playing across the world for the past few seasons, and he is banking on that experience to shine in his next assignment. ""I've sort of been away playing T20 tournaments on and off for the last four years or so,"" he said. ""I have more of an understanding (now) but still it's a challenge to be able to get your skills up."" Watson also praised CSK's ""world class"" leadership group for backing him during an up-and-down last season. ""The 2018 season was one of my better seasons, it wasn't just the final (where Watson made a match-winning century). ""But last year, certainly CSK stuck with me through thick and thin. In every other team that I've been in, I may have been dropped a couple of games before I got the runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad. ""Just them backing me, knowing my next few good innings were around the corner, (was amazing). Only world-class leaders will really stick by and have the confidence to do that, given the calibre of the players we've got."" Watson called it a great learning.

Centurion,"  Ronaldo breaches 100-goal mark for Portugal with brace against Sweden Cristiano Ronaldo scored a stunning brace to take him to 101 international goals for Portugal in a 2-0 victory over 10-man Sweden in the Nations League on Tuesday, while France won a repeat of the 2018 World Cup final 4-2 over Croatia. Ronaldo broke the mythical 100-goal mark on the stroke of half-time, the 35-year-old Juventus attacker curling in a free-kick from 25 yards over the wall and into the far left corner beyond Sweden’s stranded goalkeeper Robin Olsen for a memorable milestone in his trophy-laden career. The bonus second goal, and his 101st, came in the 72nd minute, the former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward cutting back inside the Swedish defence and producing a deft finish into the far corner from 20 yards. “They are two important goals because it means I managed to reach this mark I’d been seeking,” Ronaldo told Portuguese public television RTP. “I’m very happy, first because the team won and of course to score the 100th and then the 101st, two great goals.” While acknowledging health came first, he lamented the Covid-19 enforced empty stadium. “It’s sad playing without fans, it’s like going to the circus with no clowns or into a garden with no flowers,” Ronaldo said. “Speaking for myself, when I play away matches I like being whistled, it gives me motivation.” After making his first senior international appearance as an 18-year-old in 2003, Ronaldo notched up his first goal for Portugal in a 2-1 defeat by eventual winners Greece at Euro 2004. Ronaldo, capped 165 times by Portugal, is second only to Iran’s Ali Daei, on 109, in the list of top men’s international goal scorers. “The record, it’s step by step,” Ronaldo said. “It’s not an obsession because I think records come naturally.” Incredibly for Ronaldo, just 17 of his 100 goals have come in friendly matches, and his nine hat-tricks all came in FIFA or UEFA tournaments or qualifying games. GIROUD NEARS RECORD Oliver Giroud moved to within one goal of Michel Platini’s national record for France by converting a penalty to complete the victory over Croatia at the Stade de France. The striker was handed the opportunity to move onto 40 international goals by Antoine Griezmann, who gave away penalty duties having missed his last three for France. Giroud made no mistake in the 77th minute. A well-taken individual goal by center back Dejan Lovren put Croatia ahead, but Anthony Martial set up Griezmann for the equalizer before sliding in for a shot that hit the post, struck goalkeeper Livakovic on the back of the head, and rebounded into the net. Josip Brekalo made it 2-2, only for defender Dayot Upamecano to regain the lead for France before Giroud’s penalty. Eduardo Camavinga came on for his France debut during the second half, becoming the youngest player to represent France since the second world war at 17 years, 10 months. Belgians thrash Iceland FIFA’s number one ranked side Belgium, led superbly by Manchester City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne, handed Iceland a 5-1 drubbing to follow up on their 2-0 win over Denmark. The Islanders actually opened the scoring through an 11th-minute deflected shot from Holmbert Fridjonsson. But a reshuffled Red Devils outfit hit back almost immediately through Axel Witsel in the 13th minute, before a Michy Batshuayi double (17, 70) coupled with goals from Dries Mertens (50) and new cap Jeremy Doku (80) combined to put the game out of sight. Belgium’s win moves them to the top of League A Group 2 ahead of their trip next month to England, who were lucky to escape with a 0-0 draw away to Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday. The best opportunities to break the deadlock for both sides came in the final 10 minutes as firstly Christian Eriksen blazed over from Yussuf Poulsen’s cushioned header. At the other end, his former Tottenham teammate Harry Kane thought he had notched the winner deep in stoppage time as he rounded Kaspar Schmeichel and fired goalwards only for Mathias Jorgensen to make a brilliant goal-line clearance.

Nowhere near guys like Kohli: Malan,"  England batsman Dawid Malan is not a sure starter despite averaging close to 50 in T20Is and says he can only be compared to guys like Virat Kohli if he played at least 50 games. Batting at number three, Malan has been sensational in his 16-game old T20 career, scoring 682 runs, including an unbeaten hundred, at an average of 48.71. The 33-year-old got to play regularly against Pakistan and Australia in absence of Jason Roy and Ben Stokes. “The type of player I am, I quite like to know where I stand in the team set up, which is why I said when you get played in the series you know exactly what you are going to do. “I don’t think I am anywhere near Virat Kohli and those guys even though the numbers suggest.

Full-fledged women’s IPL will be great for India: Jhulan,"  Veteran India seamer Jhulan Goswami feels the introduction of a full-fledged women’s IPL will be a great thing for the country, the game and its young players. The BCCI has been working on starting the women’s IPL but is currently content with organising a women’s T20 challenge alongside the men’s league. In a conversation with SportsTiger’s show Off-the-Field, Goswami said, “As far as IPL is concerned, we do wish for the full-fledged tournament should start and we are all waiting for that. “Women’s IPL will be a big achievement for the country and for young cricketers as they are going to share the dressing room with top-notch Indian and international talent.” The highest wicket-taker in the women’s game, the 37-year-old bowler believes that age is just a number and what matters the most is the passion for the sport. “As a professional athlete, you never think about age. You just go on with your passion, hard work and love for the game. “You just want to be on the ground as much as possible and that is the most satisfying factor for any athlete. And I am just enjoying myself.”             ",sports
"Yuvraj decides to come out of retirement, writes to BCCI","  World Cup-winning former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has decided to come out of retirement, giving in to a request from the Punjab Cricket Association more than a year after he called it quits. The Player of the Tournament at the 2011 World Cup, Yuvraj had announced his retirement from all forms of cricket last June. PCA secretary Puneet Bali was the first person to approach the 38-year-old Yuvraj with an offer to come out of retirement for the benefit of Punjab cricket. ""Initially, I wasn't sure that I wanted to take up the offer,"" Yuvraj was quoted as saying by 'Cricbuzz'. ""I was done with domestic cricket, though I did want to continue to play in other domestic franchise-based leagues worldwide if I got permission from the BCCI. ""But I also couldn't ignore Mr Bali's request. I gave it a lot of thought, for nearly three or four weeks, and it was almost as if I didn't even have to make a conscious decision in the end."" While working with the young Punjab quartet of Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Prabhsimran Singh and Anmolpreet Singh at the nets in the last few months, Yuvraj rediscovered his love and motivation for the game. Bali told PTI that the dashing southpaw has written to BCCI president Sourav Ganguly in this regard. ""I know he has written a letter to BCCI president Sourav Ganguly wanting to come out of retirement,"" he revealed. ""We want him in the team and the way he mentored four young boys Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Prabh Simran Singh and Anmolpreet Singh was exceptional. I told him that please give at least one more year of your life to Punjab cricket,"" said. This is another twist to a career that has been punctuated with heroics on the cricket field that saw him win innumerable trophies, player of the tournaments awards, a battle with cancer and a comeback after enduring the ordeal when the world thought Yuvraj was done and dusted with. Delighted with chatter around his comeback, Bali said, ""Punjab cricket needs him. He still has a lot to give as player and mentor. What I know is that he had written to dada two weeks ago. The response must have come by now."" Yuvraj's mother Shabnam Singh, a constant pillar of support in his life, said he still retains the passion for the game. ""He is coming back (fro Dubai) in a couple of days time and then we are going to have a long chat around all of this. Whatever you are hearing must be true,"" Shabnam told PTI. On Tuesday, there was buzz that he was eyeing a stint in the Big Bash League and Cricket Australia is trying to help him find a team. As per BCCI rules, only retired cricketers can play overseas leagues. During his long international career, Yuvraj regaled all with his explosive batting, brilliant fielding and his more than handy left-arm spin bowling. When contacted by PTI, his father Father Yograj Singh said, ""He retired after 20 years of competitive cricket last year and it was his personal decision which I didn't interfere. But even then I felt that he shouldn't have retired."" ""He is a giver. In these times, in scorching heat, he trained Shubman, Prabh and Abhishek for five hours each day. ""The way he hit sixes at the new PCA stadium in Mullanpur, everyone wanted him to come back. If he plays at least three years for punjab, he will give back at two 2 world-class players to Indian cricket. So he must play.""  ",sports
"T20I rankings: Rahul & Kohli remain in top 10, Malan moves to No. 1","  India's KL Rahul and Virat Kohli have been able to remain in top 10 of the ICC T20I player rankings for batsmen which got updated on Wednesday. While Rahul has lost two spots to move down to number four, skipper Kohli has moved up to the ninth position. England batsman Dawid Malan has seized the numero uno spot after a fruitful home series against Australia, which the hosts won 2-1. The 33-year-old left-hander has progressed four places after a series-topping run aggregate of 129, which included a player of the match effort of 66 in the first fixture. Malan, whose previous best ranking was second in November last year, is now eight rating points ahead of Pakistan's Babar Azam. Malan's teammates Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler have also made headway in Wednesday's update. Bairstow has gained three slots to reach a career-best 19th position after scoring 72 runs in the series while Buttler has moved from 40th to 28th after scoring 121 runs in two matches, which also won him the player of the series award. For Australia, captain Aaron Finch's 125 runs in the series have helped him retain third position. Glenn Maxwell also holds on to his sixth position among batsmen while gaining one slot to reach second position in the list of all-rounders led by Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi. England leg-spinner Adil Rashid has gained two slots to reach seventh position after finishing as the most successful bowler in the series with six wickets, while Australia left-arm spinner Ashton Agar's five wickets have enabled him retain third position, behind the Afghanistan spin pair of Rashid Khan and Mujeeb ur Rahman.

Dominant win,"  No 3 Thiem cruises into last eight, Medvedev sets up all-Russian QF tie Don’t tell Dominic Thiem the US Open is diminished in any way just because it’s the first Grand Slam tournament since the 2004 French Open without at least one of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. “It doesn’t matter at all if the Big Three are here or not,” the No 2-seeded Thiem said on Monday after beating No 15 Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6 (4), 6-1, 6-1 in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows. “Everybody wants their hands on the trophy,” said Thiem, who won almost half of Auger-Aliassime’s service points, 46 of 88. “It doesn’t really matter who they’re going to beat.” Djokovic — seeded No 1, unbeaten this season and the overwhelming favorite — was disqualified on Sunday after unintentionally hitting a line judge in the throat with a ball after dropping a game in the first set against Pablo Carreño Busta. Nadal (pandemic concerns) and Federer (two knee operations) did not enter the tournament at all. This ends a run of 13 consecutive major championships won by a member of the Big Three. “It’s been getting pretty boring,” said Denis Shapovalov, the first Canadian man to reach the US Open quarterfinals, “with these three guys winning every tournament.” None of the men left has ever earned so much as one Slam trophy yet. The quarterfinals on the bottom half of the draw will be Thiem against No 21 Alex de Minaur; and No 10 Andrey Rublev against No 3 Daniil Medvedev. On the top half, where Djokovic used to loom: No 12 Shapovalov vs No 20 Carreño Busta; No 5 Alexander Zverev vs No 27 Borna Coric. Medvedev was runner-up to Nadal last year, losing in five sets. He hasn’t dropped a set while advancing to the quarterfinals and he’s dropped serve only three times. “I’m playing better every match,” Medvedev said. “I hope this can continue. I’m pleased, actually, with the fact I’ve won all the sets.” Thiem is the only remaining man who has contested multiple major finals. He is 0-3, losing twice to Nadal at the French Open and to Djokovic at the Australian Open this February. “I am probably one of the oldest players left in the field,” said the 27-year-old Thiem, “which is surreal to me.” Second oldest, actually: Carreño Busta is 29. It’s the first US Open since 2010 without at least one male quarterfinalist who is 30 or older. Next up for Thiem is the 21-year-old de Minaur, who reached his first major quarterfinal by saving four set points in the opening tiebreaker and going on to a 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-2 victory over Vasek Pospisil. Pospisil led 6-2 in the tiebreaker when it all fell apart. “The momentum definitely changed after that,” de Minaur said. Pospisil, who is 30, praised his younger opponent’s court coverage, saying he thinks de Minaur might be the second-fastest player on tour. “What’s most impressive is he never breathes. He runs side to side and he's never out of breath,” Pospisil said. “He defies the laws of biology, I guess. He's a freak of nature.”  ",sports
Serena survives scare,"  Serena Williams had to summon up every last ounce of strength to depose 15th seed Maria Sakkari in three hard-fought sets on Monday. The 38-year-old American needed almost two and a half hours to dislodge her 25-year-old Greek opponent 6-3, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3 inside an empty Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York. “She’s such a good competitor. It was a really intense match,” said Williams, who had been dumped out of a US Open tuneup tournament by the same opponent last month. “I felt like she almost played better today. I was a little fatigued last time and had some cramps. Just felt like I was able to compete longer,” Williams added. Williams rallied from two games down in the deciding set, pumping herself up with loud screams that echoed around the spectator-free arena as she broke Sakkari twice to clinch the last-eight spot. “I’m super passionate. This is my job. This is what I wake up to do. This is what I train to do 365 days of the year,” Williams said afterwards. The American will play Tsvetana Pironkova for a place in the semi-finals after the Bulgarian ousted Alize Cornet in another draining three-setter.   Pironkova rolls on Pironkova, who is playing her first tournament in three years after a lengthy break during which she gave birth to her son, prevailed 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 at the Louis Armstrong Stadium. “It’s absolutely unreal, I really can’t believe it,” said Pironkova, whose last tournament appearance before this year’s US Open was the 2017 Wimbledon championships when she exited in the second round. Also, unseeded Victoria Azarenka came from a set down to oust 20th seed Karolina Muchova 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 in 2hr 30min. However, second seed Sofia Kenin was sent crashing out of the tournament, beaten in straight sets by Elise Mertens. Kenin, the highest seeded player left in the fray and winner of the 2020 Australian Open, was bundled out of the last 16 6-3, 6-3, in 1hr 14 mins by Mertens.

No!whack,"  Djoker hits lines woman by mistake, rules show the door The way Novak Djokovic was playing on the tennis court in 2020 — before and after (even during) the shutdown caused by a pandemic — something extraordinary had to happen for him to lose a match. And it did. On Sunday at the 2020 US Open, already being played in eerie circumstances in New York, the world No 1 was knocked out of the tournament. The reason? Not him playing bad tennis. Not his opponent having an incredible day. Djokovic was disqualified without even a set being complete because he hit the ball at a line judge. The Serbian tennis star seemingly accidentally struck one of the line judges with a ball in frustration during his last-16 match against Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta. Against the unseeded Carreno Busta, Djokovic was doing what he does best in the first set: play efficient tennis without over-exerting himself and waiting to pounce on mistakes from his opponent. At 4-5, on the Spaniard’s serve, it seemed as if that moment had arrived. Djokovic had three set points and Carreno Busta was on the brink of losing the first set without having actually played all that badly. The set would have been over but for an incredible challenge. Down 0-40, Carreno Busta hit a forehand that was called out, but Hawkeye showed it was a hair’s breadth inside the baseline. Carreno Busta fought through that game to keep the set on serve. The frustrations were starting to show for Djokovic as he angrily smashed the ball into the side of the court. In the 11th game of the set, Djokovic was down 0-30 when he slipped and fell on the court while landing on his left shoulder. He slumped to the court on his knees in pain, and a trainer had to come out to attend the injury mid-game. After receiving treatment, Djokovic was striking the ball alright but 0-30 soon ended up becoming a break of serve. The Spaniard had a chance to close out the first set but as the players started to make their ways to their chairs, the moment that will be talked about for a long time unfolded.   The moment Djokovic appeared to be looking the other way when he pulled the ball from his pocket and smacked it in the direction of the official, it hitting her full toss in the throat. The official cried out and began gasping for air as she collapsed to the ground. Her struggle to breathe properly was clearly heard on the broadcast. Djokovic and officials rushed over to her to check if she was okay and placed his hand on her back as she struggled to breathe. After a few minutes she got up and walked off the court looking dazed. Around ten minutes of discussions then ensued between Djokovic and the tournament referee Soeren Friemel along side other officials, during which the top seed pleaded his case. He was heard saying “game penalty, set penalty, (there are) many options.” The umpire then declared that Carreno Busta had won by default. Djokovic shook hands with his opponent before leaving the court.   What do the rules say? Usually in a tennis match, abuse of rackets or balls or unsportsmanlike conduct result in a point penalty schedule being invoked. There are multiple sections in the official rulebook that spell out such behaviour apart from a Point Penalty Schedule. “The first code violation is a warning, the second comes with a point penalty, and the third comes with a game penalty-with the offending player subject to default at the referee’s discretion at any time should the code be violated again thereafter. However, when a situation such as Sunday’s arises in a match, the Point Penalty Schedule may be bypassed in favor of an immediate default,” the US Open tournament website stated in a report. The call to default Djokovic from the tournament was taken by US Open Referee Soeren Friemel who made it clear that the Serb had no intention to hurt but the rules made the decision unavoidable based on section T which states: Section T of Article III, “On-Site Player Offenses,” of the ITF Grand Slam rulebook: The Referee in consultation with the Grand Slam Chief of Supervisors may declare a default for either a single violation of this Code or pursuant to the Point Penalty Schedule set out above (section S). In all cases of default, the decision of the Referee in consultation with the Grand Slam Chief of Supervisors shall be final and unappealable. Any player who is defaulted as herein provided shall lose all ranking points earned for that event at that tournament and may be fined up to the prize money won at the tournament in addition to any or all other fines levied with respect to the offending incident.   “Based on the facts that the ball was hit angrily, recklessly; that it went straight at the line umpire’s throat; that the line umpire was clearly hurt and in pain, the decision was made that Novak had to be defaulted,” Friemel said. “The facts were discussed and explained by the chair umpire and the Grand Slam Supervisor,” Friemel said. “In this situation, it is especially important that we are 100 percent sure what exactly happened. The facts were established, and then I had to speak to Novak Djokovic, (to) give him the chance to state his point of view. “His point was that he didn’t hit the line umpire intentionally... We all agree that he didn’t do it on purpose, but the facts are still that he hit the line umpire and that the line umpire was clearly hurt.”   Djokovic's reaction Choosing not to do a press conference, Djokovic went directly to his car and left the Flushing Meadows site in New York. The 33-year-old later posted an apology on Instagram saying he was “so sorry.” “This whole situation has left me really sad and empty. I checked on the lines person and the tournament told me that thank God she is feeling ok. I’m extremely sorry to have caused her such stress. So unintended. So wrong. I’m not disclosing her name to respect her privacy. As for the disqualification, I need to go back within and work on my disappointment and turn this all into a lesson for my growth and evolution as a player and human being. I apologize to the @usopen tournament and everyone associated for my behavior. I’m very grateful to my team and family for being my rock support, and my fans for always being there with me. Thank you and I’m so sorry.” - via Instagram / Novak Djokovic  ",sports
Stokes may miss first part of IPL,"  IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals is likely to miss its premier all-rounder Ben Stokes during the first part of the T20 event as the World Cup-winner is currently in New Zealand to be with his ailing father Ged. Stokes left for Christchurch in the middle of the Test series against Pakistan last month after his father, a former All Blacks International, was diagnosed with brain cancer. “As per quarantine rules in New Zealand, Ben has just completed his 14-day isolation period after reaching New Zealand. Now he will be meeting his father and obviously he would like to spend some quiet time with his family in this time of crisis,” a source privy to developments in the franchise told PTI. Stokes has been bought by Royals for Rs 12.5 crore. “It is only logical that if he has just completed his quarantine, he would not be available for the first part of the IPL and that is completely understandable. The franchise will not even call Ben as this is not priority at the moment. Let him spend quality family time and any discussions on his availability can happen only after that,” the source added. It is understood that the franchise will “wait” for Stokes to get back to the management and only if the cricketer confirms his availability for the second half, it will take things forward. The 29-year-old has played 67 Tests, 95 ODIs and 26 T20 Internationals.

Aged 17 years and 311 days, Fati scored in the 32nd minute at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium, when he cut in from the left and curled into the bottom corner. It came after a spell-binding opening half an hour from the youngster, whose driving run had already earned a penalty for Sergio Ramos to convert. Ramos then headed in to make it two before Fati made history on his first start for Spain, beating the country’s previous youngest scorer, Juan Errazquin, who scored three goals aged 18 against Switzerland in 1925. Manchester City’s new signing Ferran Torres made it four late on as Spain registered their first victory in this season’s Nations League to go top of League A’s Group 4. Fati is now the youngest player to score for Spain, for Barca in La Liga and the youngest to score in the Champions League as well. In Basel, Germany’s wait for a win in the Nations League continued with a 1-1 draw against Switzerland. Germany looked in control after Ilkay Gundogan’s 14th-minute goal but slowly allowed Switzerland back into the game before Silvan Widmer leveled for the hosts. Since 2018, Germany has played six games in the first two editions of the Nations League and won none of them, despite scoring the opening goal in its last fourmatches in the competition.   ",sports
"Kohli, ABD feel this could be ‘breakthrough season’ for RCB","  Virat Kohli has been able to “disconnect” from the underwhelming seasons that he and Royal Challengers Bangalore have endured in the IPL and there is a welcome “sense of calm” as he prepares to lead the side this year, something he last felt in 2016. “The 2016 IPL, we all loved to be a part of (it). Since then, this is the most balanced I have felt about (the) squad,” the Indian skipper said on RCB’s Youtube show Bold Diaries, sharing his thoughts on the upcoming edition starting September 19. Kohli said that both he and AB de Villiers feel that this could be the “breakthrough season” when tables will turn for the franchise which has flattered to deceive on many occasions. “I (have) never felt so calm going into a season before. He (ABD) is coming from a very different space and he is enjoying his life and is very relaxed and fit as ever. I feel I am in a much better space, much more balanced, when it comes to environment of (the) IPL,” the straight speaking RCB skipper said. This is the first time he feels that he isn’t carrying any baggage. “Disconnecting with things that have happened in the past and not taking that baggage, as we have done that way too many times,” he responded to a query on what has changed for him this season. “Just because we have a bunch of players that are so skilled, people like seeing them play is the reason people have had so much expectation as well.” Kohli said adding to his confidence is the presence of South African pacer Chris Morris, Australian white-ball skipper Aaron Finch and his unknown compatriot Josh Philippe, a 23-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman. “Morris brings in a lot of balance. Aaron Finch is someone who has experience of playing international cricket for a while. Some of the youngsters we have picked this time are quite exciting too like Josh Philippe, a very exciting player,” the skipper said.  ",sports
Fati becomes youngest Spain scorer in 4-0 win over Ukraine,"  Teenager Ansu Fati became the youngest player to score for Spain in a 4-0 win against Ukraine in the Nations League. Fati on Sunday scored Spain's third goal from outside the area in the 32nd minute to become the country's youngest scorer at the age of 17 years, 311 days. The previous record was held by Juan Errazquin, who scored for Spain in 1925 at 18 years, 344 days. Fati started his strong performance by dribbling past Oleksandr Tymchyk before he was tripped by Serhiy Kryvtsov in the area. That set up Sergio Ramos to go to the penalty spot in the third minute and score his first of two goals. Spain coach Luis Enrique said he had rarely seen the level of confidence that Barcelona forward Fati has displayed with the national team since his debut on Thursday against Germany. ""It is not normal,"" Luis Enrique said. ""At his age it is very easy for the hype to get to you, but Ansu is mature enough to stay on the path that he is following. He is level-headed and with his feet on the ground."" Ramos got his second with a header in the 29th, netting his 23rd international goal to move level with Alfredo Di St fano as Spain's eighth all-time leading scorer. New Manchester City signing Ferran Torres capped the win with a goal in the 84th after coming on as a substitute. Spain leads its Nations League group with four points after Germany drew 1-1 with Switzerland. Ukraine has three points, Germany two and Switzerland one in Group 4 of League A. Luis Enrique continued to rejuvenate his side, giving debuts to Manchester City defender Eric Garc a and Real Madrid defender Sergio Reguil n. The match was played at Real Madrid's Alfredo Di St fano training ground without fans due to coronavirus health measures. Making his first start for Spain, Fati impressed from the first touch, putting the ball through Tymchyk's legs. He continued to trouble the right back and almost scored from a bicycle kick that hit a defender on the line. Then came his swerving shot from long range that went in off the post. ""The truth is that it is a point of pride to work with Luis (Enrique) and these players, who have received me with open arms,"" Fati said after the match. ""I will keep working, stay humble, and let things come my way."" Fati, born in Guinea-Bissau, was given Spanish citizenship last year. On Thursday, he became Spain's youngest debutante since ngel Zubieta in 1936. He started a move in the final seconds of the match against Germany that led to the equaliser in a 1-1 draw. It has been a stunning breakout year for the youngster, as he piled up the milestones for precocious scoring. Fati became the youngest player to score for Barcelona in the Spanish league at the age of 16 years, 304 days, on Aug. 31, 2019. Two weeks later he became the youngest player to score at Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium. On December 10, he became the youngest player to score in a Champions League match in a 2-1 win at Inter Milan.   ",sports
Bopanna-Shapovalov enter quarters,"  India veteran Rohan Bopanna and his Canadian partner Denis Shapovalov stunned sixth seeds Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies in a hard-fought three-setter to advance to the quarterfinals of the US Open men’s doubles event here. The unseeded Indo-Canadian pair on Saturday overcame a set deficit to beat the German duo 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a second round encounter that lasted one hour and 47 minutes. Bopanna and Shapovalov will take on Dutch-Romanian combination of Jeal-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau in the quarterfinals. Bopanna is the lone surviving Indian in the tournament after the exit of Sumit Nagal and Divij Sharan. While Sumit Nagal bowed out in the second round after losing in straight sets to world no. 3 and second seed Dominic Thiem of Austria, Sharan and his Serbian partner Nikola Cacic were knocked out in the opening round of the men’s doubles event by eighth seeds Nikola Mektic and Wesley Koolhof.

Serena wins all-US tie,"  In danger of her earliest exit at the U.S. Open since her debut 22 years ago, Serena Williams turned things around and took over against Sloane Stephens. Williams emerged from the third-round matchup between two Americans who are past champions at Flushing Meadows - she’s won six of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles at the place - with a 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over 2017 titlist Stephens on Saturday. Afterward, Williams’ 3-year-old daughter, Olympia, wore a mask and waved at Mom while sitting on her father's lap in a front-row seat. On her way to the locker room, Williams waved back. “I hope,” Williams said, “that she saw her mama fighting.” Williams did it, as she so often does, with her best-in-the-game serve, hitting 12 aces at up to 122 mph as it got really dialed in midway through the second set, and an ability to re-calibrate her groundstrokes that were so awry early and so superb down the stretch. “She served a lot better,” said Stephens, now 1-6 against Williams, although they hadn't played each other since 2015. “Obviously she has one of the greatest serves in the game. It’s really difficult to read.” Williams collected 10 of the last 12 games by lifting her level, to be sure. But it helped that Stephens went from playing nearly perfectly to missing more and more. Following mistakes, Stephens would look over at her coach, Kamau Murray, or smack her right thigh with her palm so loudly that it echoed through a nearly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium. “In that first set, I don’t think she made any errors, honestly. She was playing so clean. I said, ‘I don’t want to lose in straight sets,” said Williams, whose only career U.S. Open loss before the fourth round came in the third against Irina Spirlea in 1998 at age 16. Williams, who turns 39 in three weeks, said she told herself Saturday: “OK, Serena, just get a game. Get a game.” There were, of course, no fans - banned because of the coronavirus pandemic - and so the whole thing was flush with the feel of a practice session, rather than a high-stakes contest on a Grand Slam stage. There were some other players on hand to watch, including 15th-seeded Maria Sakkari, who sipped orange juice and ate lunch while on her player suite's balcony. Sakkari had a vested interest: She faces Williams for a berth in the quarterfinals. Other women into the fourth round: No. 16 Elise Mertens, No. 20 Karolina Muchova and Tsvetana Pironkova, who defeated No. 18 Donna Vekic 6-4, 6-1. In men’s action, 2019 runner-up Daniil Medvedev and another semifinalist from a year ago, No. 6 Matteo Berrettini moved on, as did No. 10 Andrey Rublev, No. 15 Felix Auger-Aliassime, No. 21 Alex de Minaur and Vasek Pospisil, who's been in the news lately because he teamed up with Novak Djokovic to set up a new association to represent players. Pospisil eliminated No. 8 Roberto Bautista Agut 7-5, 2-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, and next faced another five-set winner, de Minaur, who defeated No. 11 Karen Khachanov 6-4, 0-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. Williams vs. Sakkari is a rematch of their meeting won last month by Sakkari at the            Western & Southern Open, a hard-court tournament played at the U.S. Open site instead of its usual home in Ohio because of the pandemic. ""You know, Serena is Serena,"" Sakkari said after advancing earlier Saturday by beating 19-year-old American Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 6-1. ""You have to come up with some great tennis. Otherwise there is no chance against her."" Stephens did that very thing in the early stages Saturday. She was playing patient, wait-for-the-right-moment tennis, creating lengthy, complicated points that more often than not ended with Williams blinking first. The end of the first set was met by total silence - not even the awkward, manufactured soundtrack piped in during other matches to simulate ambient noise. From 2-all in the second, Williams finally made inroads. She saved a break point, then broke for the first time when Stephens missed a forehand, part of a stretch in which Williams grabbed 12 of 15 points. She was on her way. And now she is four wins from adding to her Grand Slam trophy count, which has been at 23 since she won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant. Asked Saturday what the positives are about still being active on tour as a parent, Williams said: “One day, your daughter can say she was there. Whether she remembers or not, we can always have pictures. But other than that, it’s just (a) minus, like: I'm not with her, I’m not around her. It's hard.” Williams has reached the finals at four of the past seven major tournaments, losing each time. “We all hope she gets to it,” Stephens said. “If she is feeling pressure, I hope she releases it and gets to 24.”  ",sports
"BCCI finally releases IPL schedule, MI to face CSK in opener","  Ending days of anxious wait, the BCCI on Sunday released the schedule for the upcoming IPL, and in keeping with tradition, defending champions Mumbai Indians will take on runners-up Chennai Super Kings in the opener in Abu Dhabi on September 19. Moved out of India due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, the upcoming edition of the world's biggest T20 league will be held in the three venues of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah in the UAE. After the tournament-opener in the capital city, Dubai will host its first game the next day when Delhi Capitals take on Kings XI Punjab followed by the third match on Monday between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bangalore. The action will then shift to Sharjah on September 22 when Rajasthan Royals will host Chennai Super Kings. There will be 10 double headers, with the first match starting at 3:30pm IST and the second 7:30pm, according to a BCCI release. In all, 24 matches will be held in Dubai, 20 in Abu Dhabi and 12 in Sharjah. Venues for the playoffs and the IPL 2020 final will be announced later. The final is slated for November 10. The upcoming 53-day edition is by far the longest in the history of the league. The schedule was expected to be out in the last week of August but the announcement was delayed after 13 personnel of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) camp tested positive for the dreaded virus. Also, due to different quarantine rules in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, IPL's operations team took time to finalise the schedule. As per IPL rules, the defending champions and the last year's runner-up face off in the tournament opener. The same is going to happen this year after concerns over Chennai Super Kings' readiness were erased with their first practice session in Dubai on Friday. CSK were the last franchise to hit the nets after clearing final rounds of COVID-19 testing. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and all other CSK players, except for the COVID-19 afflicted duo of Deepak Chahar and Ruturaj Gaikwad, started training on Friday. With Deepak and Ruturaj testing positive last week along with 11 members of the CSK contingent, the team was forced to delay its training plan after completing the six-day quarantine, including three tests, upon arrival on August 21. The virus free players had to undergo three additional tests before beginning their training on Friday. The infected players are in 14-day quarantine. This year's IPL was originally scheduled to be held from March 29 to May 24 but was postponed barely two weeks before the start of the tournament due to the coronavirus outbreak. Then, as the number of cases increased, the league was indefinitely postponed but the postponement of the T20 World Cup cleared the decks for the league to take place in the September-November window.

Mladenovic out of US Open because of coronavirus quarantine,"  The top-seeded women's doubles team was dropped from the U.S. Open because one of the players, Kristina Mladenovic of France, was issued a quarantine notice by public health officials from the county where her tournament hotel is. Mladenovic was one of seven players placed under extra restrictions during the tournament after contact tracing determined she potentially could have been exposed to COVID-19 by Benoit Paire, the only entrant to test positive. The U.S. Tennis Association announced Saturday that it was removing Mladenovic and her partner, Timea Babos of Hungary, saying it was obligated to adhere to government guidance. Mladenovic and Babos were supposed to play their second-round match against Gabriela Dabrowski of Canada and Alison Riske of the U.S., who advanced via walkover. Mladenovic had been allowed to compete until Saturday, playing two matches in singles she lost in the second round after blowing a 6-1, 5-1 lead and winning one in doubles. And the other half-dozen players found to have contact with Paire also played in the tournament, including No. 32 seed Adrian Mannarino in men's singles, whose match Friday was delayed for more than 2 hours until it was determined he could play. He lost. The USTA said the new quarantine orders arrived after Mannarino's match and meant those players identified as having prolonged close contact with the infected player will quarantine in their rooms for the remainder of their quarantine period. Mary Ellen Laurain, a spokeswoman for the Nassau County Department of Health, said medical privacy rules prevented her from discussing the cases of individual players. But she said 14-day quarantine orders are issued for any person living or staying in the county, including at hotels, who has had contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. FORZA, BERRETTINI! No fans are allowed inside the gates at the U.S. Open because of the pandemic, but 2019 semifinalist Matteo Berrettini's most loyal supporter found a way to offer encouragement Saturday by yelling from outside a fence near Court 17. After beating No. 30 seed Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 to return to the fourth round at Flushing Meadows, No. 6 Berrettini was asked whether he was aware of his pal's attempts to be heard. Nobody didn't hear him, said Berrettini, a 24-year-old from Rome. Was really loud today. I think louder than the other days. The fan is also Italian and owns the restaurant on Manhattan's Lower East Side where Berrettini went for dinner most nights during his lengthy stay in New York a year ago. His pal even sat in Berrettini's guest box during that run, wearing a shirt festooned with the word Carbonara. On Saturday, he was outside the fence, shouting in Italian, saying phrases that mean Let's go! or Be strong! NOT BAD, EH? Everyone's been anticipating big things from young Canadians Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is 20 and seeded 15th, and Denis Shapovalov, who's 21 and seeded 12th and they're both still around at this year's U.S. Open. What about another player from Canada, Vasek Pospisil? He's 30, ranked 94th and hadn't played an official match since February when he arrived at Flushing Meadows. To be honest, Pospisil said, I wasn't expecting a lot. Well, now Pospisil is into the fourth round for the first time in nine appearances at the U.S. Open, thanks to his upset of No. 8 Roberto Bautista Agut by a 7-5, 2-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 score Saturday. That followed Pospisil's elimination of another seed, No. 25 Milos Raonic, who just so happens to be from Canada, too. Pospisil is dealing with an abdominal strain and a thigh strain but hanging in there. I think I'm more mature. I'm better at using my energy more (carefully), said Pospisil, who won the 2014 Wimbledon doubles title with Jack Sock. As you get older, you figure those things out better. Pospisil, who is helping Novak Djokovic start a new association for men's tennis players, can get to the second Grand Slam singles quarterfinal of his career by beating No. 21 seed Alex de Minaur of Australia next.

Un-believable,"  Borna Coric comes back from 1-5 down in the 4th set, saving six match points, to beat Tsitsipas  Croat Borna Coric saved six match points as he rallied from 5-1 down in the fourth set to stun Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4) and send the fourth seed tumbling out of US Open in the third round on Friday. In the sort of late drama that would on any other year have had the Flushing Meadows crowd baying for more, Coric staged a remarkable comeback at an empty Louis Armstrong Stadium to reach the fourth round after the fifth set tiebreak. The gritty 27th seed had looked down for the count when Tsitsipas twice served for the match in the fourth set but the 22-year-old Greek faltered with victory in his grasp. Coric again had to come from a break down in the fifth but looked indefatigable even after 4 and 1/2 hours on court and secured a famous victory on his second match point. “I just have to be honest and have to say that I was real lucky,” said Coric, who will face Australian Jordan Thompson on Sunday for a spot in his first Grand Slam quarter-final. Earlier, Alexander Zverev feared his tie with Adrian Mannarino might not go ahead due to coronavirus protocols but the German secured a 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 win in a match delayed almost three hours due to talks between the organisers and New York health officials. The third-round clash was originally scheduled to start at 2.30pm local time at Louis Armstrong Stadium but was pushed back while the United States Tennis Association engaged in “collaborative dialogue” with health officials. “I was told there is very little chance that we were going to play,” Zverev said courtside after the match. “The New York State called and said he (Mannarino) shouldn’t play. “So it was back and forth, back and forth... it was political, not about us players.” Zverev next faces Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who defeated Britain’s Cameron Norrie 7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 6-2, 6-1. Top seed Novak Djokovic continued his dominance of Jan-Lennard Struff with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win to advance to the fourth round. The three-time champion at Flushing Meadows and 17-time Grand Slam winner was never really pushed by the German, who has taken just one set off the Serb in their five career meetings. The only drama came early on when Struff had break-point opportunities but could not convert against Djokovic’s serve in the first game.  ",sports
Osaka survives scare,"  Two-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka battled into the last 16 of the US Open on Friday, requiring three sets to defeat 18-year-old Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk. Osaka, the 2018 US Open champion, needed 2 hours and 33 minutes to beat the unseeded world No 137 6-3, 6-7 (4/7), 6-2 inside an empty Arthur Ashe Stadium. “She was very good. I’m kind of scared of how she is going to be in the future,” Osaka said of her vanquished opponent. Frustration got the better of the Japanese fourth seed in the second set. After recovering from 5-3 to force a tie-break she threw her racquet when Kostyuk tied the match 1-1. But Osaka’s experience came through in the deciding set as she held her serve and broke Kostyuk twice to set up a match against 14th seed Anett Kontaveit. Kontaveit progressed by beating 24th seed Magda Linetter 6-3, 6-2. Osaka, of Haitian and Japanese heritage, walked onto the court wearing a facemask emblazoned with the name of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man who was shot dead in broad daylight while jogging in the town of Brunswick, in southern Georgia, in February. Osaka is wearing different masks honoring victims of racial injustice and police brutality throughout the tournament. Germany’s 17th seed Angelique Kerber also progressed to the fourth round, making light work of American Ann Li 6-3, 6-4. Kerber, the 2016 US Open, will go up against Jennifer Brady for a quarter-final spot after the American 28th seed knocked out Caroline Garcia 6-3, 6-3. Petra Kvitova struggled with unforced errors but still had enough weapons to defeat American Jessica Pegula 6-4, 6-3 to advance to the fourth round. The two-time Wimbledon champion had 28 unforced errors and five double faults but moved up a gear when it mattered to win her first career meeting with baseline battler Pegula. Next up for her will be another American in Shelby Rogers, who earlier advanced with a 6-2, 6-4 win against compatriot Madison Brengle. In other games, eighth seed Petra Martic swept aside unseeded Varvara Gracheva 6-3, 6-3. Martic will play Yulia Putintseva in the last 16 after the 23rd seed powered past Vera Lapko 6-3, 6-3.

Hamilton sets speed record to take Monza pole,"  Lewis Hamilton claimed pole position with a new lap record at Monza for Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix with Valtteri Bottas taking second in Saturday qualifying for another Mercedes front row lock-out. McLaren’s Carlos Sainz posted the third fastest time and is joined on the second row by Sergio Perez for Racing Point. The session proved another humbling experience for out-of-sorts Ferrari with Sebastian Vettel going out in Q1 and Charles Leclerc, who won at the circuit last year, in Q2. This means no Ferrari inside the top 10 at Monza for the first time since 1984. The championship leader and six-time champion clocked a fastest lap in one minute and 18.887 seconds to beat the Finn by 0.069 seconds. In pure speed, Hamilton’s track lap record performance produced an unconfirmed fastest lap in F1 history. It was Hamilton’s record-increasing 94th career pole position, his sixth in seven races and his seventh in Italy. “It wasn’t too bad,” said Hamilton, with a hint of a smile. “It was a fantastic performance from the team — in terms of timing, when they put us out on the track,” said Hamilton. Max Verstappen was fifth for Red Bull, Lando Norris qualified sixth in the second McLaren ahead of Daniel Ricciardo of Renault, Lance Stroll in the second Racing Point, Alex Albon in the second Red Bull and Pierre Gasly of Alpha Tauri. Bottas also broke the track record twice and said: “It was really close as I expected. I am not sure about the tow — I didn’t have any until the end and I kind of felt the benefit, but then on the final lap I was on my own again. “It was a good place to be, but obviously we didn’t get any gains in a straight line.”  ",sports
Younger guys will feel little less pressure in empty stadium: Katich,"  Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) head coach Simon Katich feels that while younger guys will feel lesser pressure in empty stadiums but it could well be a challenge for the senior cricketers as they gear up for Indian Premier League. “Personally, I think some of the younger players actually enjoy the fact that there will be a little less pressure with less people at the ground, creating all that noise and distraction,” Katich said during RCB’s YouTube show Bold Diaries. “I think it will be more of a challenge for some of the older guys that are used to the buzz of the crowd and getting their adrenaline going. But I think there will still be a lot of motivation within our squad to go out and perform well,” he added. Experienced mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton had earlier said that cricketers like Virat Kohli who depend on external stimulation and are used to ‘pressure’ are “really going to struggle” in front of empty stadium but self-motivated players will “do a hell lot better” in this year’s IPL. Royal Challengers Bangalore led by Kohli completed their mandatory quarantine upon their arrival in Dubai and had started their training camps last week. Katich said younger players could make an impact in this year’s tournament. “I think the players will be motivated enough as there is a lot at stake in terms of the opportunity that it presents and the players want to make the most of that. They know this is a big tournament,” said the former Australia cricketer.  ",sports
"If Narine gets grip from surface, he will be effective: Gambhir","  Sunil Narine’s former IPL captain Gautam Gambhir believes that the mystery spinner will be very effective for KKR provided if he gets a “bit of grip from the UAE surfaces” during the Indian Premier League. “If Sunil Narine gets a little grip from the UAE wickets, he will be very effective,” Gambhir said on Star Sports show Cricket Connected about his former KKR teammate, who has been instrumental in their two title triumphs. “For me, the most important thing is that when Sunil Narine is hiding the ball during his run-up, it will increase the difficulties for the batsmen. It will be difficult to find which ball will go away and which ball will come in. “Because the later you see the ball in the hand, the more difficult it is for the batsmen.” Gambhir feels if Narine bowls at quicker pace he will be way more effective. “Rashid Khan is so successful because of his pace and Sunil Narine has been successful when he has bowled quicker, it is a new thing we have seen and this might make him very successful in the IPL,” the former India batsman said.

‘Incredibly consistent’ Malan delivers every single time in T20s: Nasser,"  Former England skipper Nasser Hussain has praised top-order batsman Dawid Malan for his “incredible” consistency in T20 cricket, saying the left-hander delivers every time he comes out to bat. The 33-year-old Malan, who made his debut in the shortest format of the game in 2017, has notched up a ton and seven fifties in the 14 T20Is he has featured in. Malan has been in red-hot form in T20 cricket. After playing out an unbeaten 54-run innings against Pakistan last week, he was adjudged the man of the match for his 43-ball 66 against Australia which helped England win the first T20 by 2 runs on Friday. “Every single time, he delivers. T20 is not that easy to be consistent because at times you have to go in and give it a bit of a smack, he has been incredibly consistent,” Hussain told Sky Sports. “What I like about him is that he doesn’t overhit. He’s got long levers, but you never really see Dawid Malan slogging, he’s in real control of all those shots,” he added. The 52-year-old also feels England currently have a very strong limited-overs side with several quality players going up against each other to get into the team.  ",sports
Ian Bell announces retirement,"  Realising that his days as an England player are long gone, former stylish batsman Ian Bell on Saturday announced he will retire from all forms of cricket at the end of the 2020 domestic season. The five-time Ashes winner has spent his entire career with Warwickshire. Bell has scored 7727 runs, including 22 hundreds, at an average of 42.69 in 118 Test matches while in the ODIs, he has 5,416 runs in 161 matches. “It’s with enormous sadness, but with equal pride, that I am announcing my retirement from professional cricket,” Bell said in a statement. The stylish Bell, known for his exquisite cover drives, was Man of the Series in one of the five Ashes triumphs and was also part of England’s memorable Test series triumph on Indian soil in 2012. “While my hunger and enthusiasm for the sport that I love remain as strong as ever, my body simply can’t keep up with the demands of the game to the standard of which I expect of myself,” Bell added. Bell, 38, retired from ODIs in 2015 to focus on Test cricket, but ironically, played his last five-day game for England the same year. Bell has never played a Test match since November 2015, failing to add to his 118 caps. “It’s true when they say you know when the time’s right, and unfortunately, my time is now,” the 38-year-old said.

However, BCB refused the NOC since Bangladesh are set to tour Sri Lanka for a three-match Test series scheduled to start on October 24, at a time when IPL will be played in the UAE. “Yes, he (Mustafizur) had an offer from the IPL but we did not give him NOC as we have the Sri Lanka tour coming up,” BCB cricket operation chairman Akram Khan was quoted as saying by cricbuzz. The 24-year-old Rahman, however, has not been in Bangladesh’s Test plans since March 2019. He took 20 wickets in the 2019 World Cup, after which he has only played ODIs and T20Is for Bangladesh. In 13 Tests since 2015, Rahman has picked 28 wickets. He last played in the IPL in 2018, turning out for Mumbai Indians. In seven matches that season, he took seven wickets at an average of 32.85 and an economy rate of 8.36. He had returned from his stint in 2018 IPL with an injury, after which BCB president Nazmul Hassan had said he won’t be allowed any more NOCs to participate in overseas leagues. The BCB had allowed Rahman to register for the IPL auction last year but he went unsold. The BCB is planning a week-long residential camp later this month ahead of the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka. Rahman is expected to be a part of the camp.  ",sports
Australia keen to help Stoinis evolve as finisher like Dhoni,"  Australia is willing to give recalled all-rounder Marcus Stoinis a longer run to help him evolve as a finisher in the mould of former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, said vice-captain Pat Cummins. Stoinis’ unbeaten 23 off 18 balls was not enough as Australia slipped from 124-2 to 148-6 to lose the opening T20I against England. Australia have a lot of quality players who bat in the top-order for their domestic T20 sides but the world number one team is still searching for a batsman in the middle-order who can finish off games. Opening the batting, 31-year old Stoinis scored 705 runs for Melbourne Stars to top the BBL runs chart last season. However, his inability to rotate the strike early in the innings has been one of the reasons why he was left out of the 2019 World Cup. “It’s something we’ve spoken about for exactly that reason — they’re all the best players when they go back to playing domestic comps,” Cummins was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald. “You could argue that middle-order role is one of the hardest in any cricket team. That’s what we’ve identified, we’ve got to give guys a go. “Someone like MS Dhoni, he was one of the best in the world because he played 300-400 ODI games. You saw during this week’s practice games we gave a lot of guys a go in that.” Cummins said Australia has identified the roles and wants to give the players enough game time to cement their places. “We know it’s not going to happen overnight. That’s been a common theme that selectors and Finchy (Aaron Finch) have spoken about: we’ll identify roles and give them a long run in that. “I think we’ve got the right squad, the right players, it’s about getting plenty of games into everyone now,” the pace spearhead said.

India will be among top 10 by 2028 Olympics: Predicts Kiran Rijiju,"  India will be amongst the top 10 medal winning countries by the 2028 Olympic Games, Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju predicted on Friday. ""By 2028 Olympics, India will be in the top 10 medal list. Without setting an ambitious target, you cannot achieve the goal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created an Olympic task force and we are making certain preparations,"" he said. Rijiju said that the Central government was leaving no stone unturned in a bid to nurture talents that could bring India laurels in the 2028 Olympic. He was speaking at the virtual launch of 'enJogo' App, designed by Bhaichung Bhutia Football School to provide online training modules to footballers. ""We have now identified talented athletes for the Junior TOP Scheme and they will be given a monthly stipend of Rs.25,000 each. These junior players will train for free and the Rs.25,000 they will get is like a salary they earn for their families,"" said Rijiju. The sports minister also acknowledged that he had received harsh comments from some sections on his ambitious projection. ""I know many people wonder how it would happen, many people gave comments...not so nice. But it is a democratic country, people will have their own views and we do not think we should respond to those comments,"" he said. ""Our job is to focus on what we want to achieve. We have to set targets, set the bar higher and focus on what we can do. I feel the target [of being in top 10 in 2028] is achievable,"" he said. To a question, the minister said the COVID-19 pandemic situation has made it difficult to say when the crowds will return to the stadiums. ""I will not be able to make a call on that. I don't know what will be the situation in the coming months,"" he said. ""I wish the fans are there in the stadium as soon as possible, we are hopeful of that happening. But health and safety of the public is also our priority,"" he added. The Home Ministry has allowed sports gatherings of up to 100 people from September 21, lifting the total ban.  ",sports
"CSK to start training after all, except 13, test negative for COVID-19 again","  Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and all other Chennai Super Kings players, except for the COVID-19 afflicted duo of Deepak Chahar and Ruturaj Gaikwad, will start training from Friday evening after clearing a third round of testing for the virus here. The results are a major relief to the franchise, which was hit by 13 positive cases last week. The event is due to start on September 19 and will be played in Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. ""The training starts from today. All others, apart from the 13, tested negative for the third time. Those who tested positive will only be tested after the isolation period (two weeks) is over,"" CSK CEO KS Viswanathan told PTI. Deepak and Ruturaj, along with 11 staff members of the contingent, will be tested twice by the end of next week when their 14-day isolation period gets over. They need to return with two negative tests before being allowed to train. Deepak is a first team starter in this line-up while Ruturaj is being groomed for the top-order in place of veteran Suresh Raina, who quit the tournament citing personal reasons and is unlikely to make a comeback. CSK starting off with their training is good news for the IPL governing council as it means that their marquee opening-round clash against the Mumbai Indians on September 19 ""is very much on"" contrary to some media speculation. No word on Harbhajan Singh There is no confirmation either from veteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh or the CSK about the delay in the off-spinner joining the camp. There is speculation that he might pull out of the tournament due to personal reasons. Viswanathan declined to comment on the issue. For the record, CSK has three front-line spinners apart from Harbhajan -- leg-spinner Imran Tahir, left-armer Mitchell Santner and seasoned leg break bowler Piyush Chawla, who was bought for a hefty sum.

Spain grabs 1-1 draw in Germany as internationals resume,"  Spain defender Gaya scored deep into stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw against Germany as the UEFA Nations League started without fans ending a 10-month international break. The Valencia defender scored in the sixth minute of injury to time to cancel out Timo Werner's opening goal on his return to his hometown Stuttgart. With international football returning for the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, all 54 games that are scheduled to take place across the continent over six days are taking place with strict hygiene measures, including the exclusion of fans. Players had to pass mandatory pregame tests for COVID-19. Werner, who was born in Stuttgart and went on to become the club's youngest scorer, gave Germany the lead in the 51st minute. He finished off a move started by a cross-field ball from Ilkay G ndogan, with debutant Robin Gosens providing the cross. Barcelona winger Ansu Fati came on for the second half to become Spain's youngest debutant since ngel Zubieta in 1936. The 17-year-old had an injury-time equalizer ruled out for a foul by Sergio Ramos in the buildup. But there was still time for Rodrigo Moreno to set up Gaya for the equalizer, with the defender converting from close range. It was Spain's first game with coach Luis Enrique back in charge following the death of his 9-year-old daughter Xana due to a type of bone cancer in August 2019. Luis Enrique had stepped down for five months before returning in November, when he couldn't have foreseen such a long wait for his next game. Germany coach Joachim L w refrained from calling up most of his Bayern Munich contingent after they played in the Champions League final on Aug. 23. Defender Niklas S le was the exception as he only recently returned from injury. Gosens started on the left to make his Germany debut after an unusual route to the senior side. The 26-year-old played in the Netherlands before joining Atalanta in Italy and never played for any of Germany's youth sides. Also in the same League A group, Ukraine defeated Switzerland 2-1. Ireland captain Shane Duffy scored in injury time for a 1-1 draw at Bulgaria, while Wales beat Finland 1-0 in League B's Group 4. Russia defeated Serbia 3-1 and Hungary beat Turkey 1-0 away in their group. In League C, Moldova drew with Kosovo 1-1, and Slovenia and Greece played out a 0-0 draw. The Faeroe Islands earned a 3-2 win over fellow minnow Malta in League D, where Latvia drew 0-0 against Andorra.   ",sports
Women’s top seed tumble trend continues,"  Under normal circumstances, Karolina Pliskova would not have been seeded No 1 at the US Open and so, while a second-round loss certainly would have been disappointing to her, and noticed by others, it wouldn’t have been as newsworthy. But what’s normal in 2020? With the women who are 1-2 in the rankings choosing to skip the trip to Flushing Meadows because of the pandemic, No 3 Pliskova ascended to the top spot in the draw — and by Day 3, she was gone. Pliskova, the 2016 runner-up at the US Open, made her mood clear during a 6-1, 7-6 (2) loss to 50th-ranked Caroline Garcia on Wednesday by throwing a racket, then again afterward with a series of clipped responses at her news conference. Pliskova fidgeted with the microphone. Sighed. Shrugged her shoulders. Rolled her eyes. When a reporter offered possible explanations for the defeat — a new, faster surface on the courts, a lack of atmosphere because there are no spectators, the pressure of her high seeding — Pliskova replied: “Nothing from what you said.” Her reasoning for the result? “I didn’t play good,” Pliksova said, “so that’s it.” When another member of the media said this back-and-forth must be boring to Pliskova, she said, “Yeah, a little bit. Did you see the match or no?” and soon after remarked, “I don’t know if you understand tennis well enough.” After a first round that went more to form than ever — 29 of 32 seeded women won their opening matches, a US Open record since the number of seeds was doubled from 16 in 2001 — the surprises started in the second round. Three Americans turned in upsets of seeded women. Shelby Rogers, ranked 93rd, beat 11th-seeded Elena Rybakina 7-5, 6-1; Ann Li, who is ranked 128th, topped 13th-seeded Alison Riske 6-0, 6-3 in a matchup between two players from Pennsylvania; and Madison Brengle, ranked 84th, took out 19th-seeded Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-3. Other seeded women who were eliminated: No 12 Marketa Vondrousova, No 30 Kristina Mladenovic, No 31 Anastasija Sevastova. Mladenovic’s loss was the wildest of them all. She led 6-1, 5-1, then later held four match points, but never was able to finish things off and ended up on the wrong end of a 1-6, 7-6 (2), 6-0 result against 102nd-ranked Varvara Gracheva. Two seeded men exited, too: No 13 Cristian Garin and No 24 Hubert Hurkacz. Unlike Pliskova, the No 1-seeded man, Novak Djokovic, only had a brief blip on his way to the third round and a 25-0 record in 2020. Going back to late last season, his winning streak is 28 matches overall. “I’m actually glad I did drop a set and got tested the way I did today against Kyle.              I expected it to be a tough, tough task,” said Djokovic, who has won five of the past seven Grand Slam tournaments to raise his major trophy total to 17, three behind Roger Federer and two behind Rafael Nadal. “I’m really glad having an early kind of tough match in the tournament,” Djokovic said, because it kind of serves me better, I think, for the rest of the tournament.” Next up for him is No 28 Jan-Lennard Struff, someone Djokovic dismissed 6-3, 6-1 last week at the Western & Southern Open. Other winners on  Wednesday included No 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas, No 5 Alexander Zverev and No 7 Davis Goffin. Tsitsipas made it to the US Open’s third round for the first time by withstanding the so-rare-these-days serve-and-volley style of his 168th-ranked American opponent, Maxime Cressy 7-6 (2), 6-3, 6-4 after two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka’s 6-1, 6-2 win against Camila Giorgi. Cressy’s loss was part of a rough day for men from the US, who went 1-7.  ",sports
Sharan & Cacic bow out,"  India’s Divij Sharan and his Serbian partner Nikola Cacic fought hard before going down in three sets to eighth seeds Nikola Mektic and Wesley Koolhof in the first round of the US Open men’s doubles event. Sharan and Cacic lost 4-6, 6-3, 3-6 against Croatia’s Mektic and Koolhof of the Netherlands in a tough contest that lasted one hour and 46 minutes on Wednesday. Inconsistency in serves played a big role in Sharan and Cacic not being able to cash in on their comeback in the second set on Wednesday. The pair made a poor start to the match but made up for it by forcing the game into a decider with a dominant 6-3 win in the second set. The winners will next play Italy’s Simone Bolelli and Maximo Gonzalez of Argentina. The other Indian in the men’s doubles draw — Rohan Bopanna — and his Canadian partner Denis Shapovalov will take on Ernesto Escobedo and Noah Rubin of the United States in the first round.  ",sports

Sumit creates history,"  Sumit Nagal became the first Indian tennis player to win a round at a Grand Slam in seven years when he downed American Bradley Klahn in his first round match, setting up a contest against world number three Dominic Thiem. Returning to the Flushing Meadows where he took a set off Roger Federer last year, the Indian got past the local rival, ranked just a rung above the Indian at 126th in the world, 6-1, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 in two hours and 12 minutes on Tuesday night. Somdev Devvarman was the last Indian to win a main draw match at a major and incidentally, it was at the US Open in 2013 when he beat Slovakia’s Lukas Lacko after coming through qualifiers. “I qualified for a junior Slam in 2013 here and then the men’s and now to win my first round here means a lot. I enjoy playing here and it has worked out in my favour few times,” Nagal said. Somdev, who retired in January 2017, had reached the second rounds of Australian Open, French Open and US Open in 2013 apart from playing a second round at the Wimbledon in 2011 but never went beyond that. Up next for him will be Austria’s top player Thiem, who advanced when his Spanish rival Jaume Munar retired before the start of the third set. Thiem was leading 7-6(6), 6-3 when Munar found it difficult to continue as he injured his knee during the second set. A fierce fighter, Nagal hardly cares for reputations and is expected to make it tough for the world number three on Thursday. “I am ready and excited to play him. It’s going to be fun and (I will) see where I stand in terms of my tennis level,” he said.  ",sports
Raina: You might see me back in CSK camp in some time,"  Suresh Raina has broken his silence over his unexpected pullout from the IPL, saying he returned to India for his family and he might even fly back to Dubai to rejoin the Chennai Super Kings for the tournament beginning September 19. Raina, who announced his international retirement alongside M S Dhoni on August 15, also rubbished reports claiming a rift between him and his longtime franchise. The contingent recorded 13 Covid-19 cases, including two players, and Raina’s pullout was attributed to that. “It was a personal decision and I had to come back for my family. There was something that needed to be addressed immediately on the home front. CSK is my family too and Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni) is very important to me and this was a tough decision,” Raina told Cricbuzz. “There is no issue between CSK and me. Nobody will just turn their back on Rs 12.5 crore and walk away without a solid reason. I might have retired from international cricket but I’m still young and I am looking forward to playing for them in the IPL for the next 4-5 years,” he said. He also dropped a hint on rejoining the team in Dubai when asked about his future with CSK. “I’ve been training even while quarantining here. You never know you might see me in the camp there again,” said the southpaw. Team owner N Srinivasan was not happy when he first got to know about Raina’s withdrawal from the tournament. The batsman said the former BCCI president is like a “father figure” to him and has every right to snap at him. “..He’s always stood by me and is close to my heart. He treats me like his younger son and am sure a lot of what he said was taken out of context. Ek baap apne bacche ko daant sakta hai(A father can scold his son). “He didn’t know the real reasons for me leaving when he gave those comments. Now he’s been informed about them and he even sent me a message thereafter. We’ve chatted about it and both CSK and I just want to get over with it,” said Raina.  ",sports
I can’t decide on Raina’s comeback: Srinivasan,"  Suresh Raina is like a “son” to him but Chennai Super Kings owner N Srinivasan on Wednesday said the all-rounder’s return to the side this IPL season after an unanticipated pullout would be decided by the team management led by skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. “I have treated him like one (son). The reason for CSK’s success in IPL over the years is because of the fact that franchise never poked its nose into cricketing matters,” Srinivasan said. “We own a team, we own the franchise but we do not own players.  Team is ours but players are not. I don’t own the players,” he added. For Srinivasan, the decision on Raina will lay with the team management, which means skipper Dhoni and CEO KS Viswanathan. “I am not the cricket captain. I have never told them (team management) whom to play, whom to take in the auction, never.  We have the greatest captain of all times. So, why shall I even interfere in cricketing matters?” Srinivasan said.    ",sports

They have been the most inspiring cricketers and leaders in the last 10 years at least. Having  the opportunity to play under them is great learning,” Rahul said when asked about the possibility of seeing shades of Kohli and Dhoni in his captaincy. “Both (Kohli and Dhoni) of them are completely different individuals and lead the team differently. But their passion for the team is the same, they always want to win and push the team together. “I also want use the same approach with my team and look to lead from the front. It should feel like a team, it should feel like family.” Rahul said he has picked up the tricks of the leadership trade not just from his India skippers but also opposition captains. “We are always constantly watching the game on the field, I always keep my eyes open to learning.

Hopefully, it (the learnings) is all stored in the back of my head (for me to use in the tournament),” said the stylish opener. To start with at least, Rahul will be opening the batting and wicket-keeping besides plotting the opposition’s downfall as captain. It could be too much work in a high-pressure event like the IPL but Rahul is excited about the challenge. “I don’t know if it is going play a part or hamper anything but I am quite looking forward to the responsibility, it is something  I have always enjoyed.

Pak end Eng tour with win,"  Veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez praised teenage debutant Haider Ali’s composure after the pair combined to set up Pakistan’s five-run victory over England in their tour-ending third T20I at Old Trafford on Tuesday. It was Pakistan’s first victory in 66 days of being in a bio-secure bubble in England and meant they squared this three-match series at 1-1 after a 1-0 loss in last month’s three-Test series. Hafeez made 86 not out and Haider 54 in Pakistan’s 190-4. There was a 20-year age gap between the 39-year-old Hafeez and the 19-year-old Haider but you would not have known it while they shared a stand of exactly 100 after coming together at 32-2. Hafeez’s knock followed his 69 in England’s five-wicket win at Old Trafford on Sunday and was his fourth fifty in his last five T20I innings. Haider came in at 2-1 after opener Fakhar Zaman was out for one but demonstrated a maturity well beyond his years during a 28-ball fifty featuring five fours and two sixes. “He was good under pressure and just expressed himself,” said player of the series Hafeez of Haider in a post-match interview with Sky Sports. “I was just trying to back him every time, tell him ‘you are playing well, continue like that,’” he added. “It is great to see youngsters coming from our system and performing well.” England were 69-4 in their chase before Moeen Ali, who should have been stumped by former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed on seven, revived their hopes with 61. But when veteran paceman Wahab Riaz, in for the injured Mohammad Amir, ran out Chris Jordan and then caught and bowled Moeen, England were 174-8 with seven balls left. They needed 12 off two balls when Tom Curran hit a six. But Curran could not repeat the shot when paceman Haris Rauf bowled a last-ball yorker.  ",sports

Osaka wears mask in memory of Breonna Taylor,"  Naomi Osaka arrived on court for her opening US Open game on Monday wearing a face mask bearing the name of Breonna Taylor, the African-American nurse shot dead by police who raided her apartment in Kentucky in March. By the time the US Open fortnight is over, Osaka says she hopes to have honored the memory of six other victims of racial injustice. “For me, I just want to spread awareness,” Osaka said after her 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 win in first round. “I’m aware that tennis is watched all over the world, and maybe there is someone that doesn’t know Breonna Taylor’s story.

The German, seeking his first Grand Slam title, took the first set on a tie-break 7-6 (7/2) before losing the second 7-5 in an eerily empty Arthur Ashe Stadium. Ultimately, the 23-year-old proved too much for the South African veteran, winning the third set 6-3 and the fourth 7-5. “I am actually quite happy with a first round like that,” said Zverev, who reached his first Grand Slam semi-final at the Australian Open earlier this year. “Kevin is not someone you usually play in a first round. This is a fourth round, quarter-final, semi-final match normally against him. I am extremely happy to be through,” he added. Fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas eased into the second round of the Flushing Meadows tournament, which is being played without fans due to coronavirus, with a straight-sets win over Spain’s Albert Ramos-Vinolas. The Greek player needed just one hour and 38 minutes to dispose of the world number 41, 6-2, 6-1, 6-1. Britain’s Cameron Norrie enjoyed one of the day’s most impressive wins, charging back from two sets down to sink Argentine ninth seen Diego Schwartzman 3-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1, 7-5. The 25-year-old looked dead and buried after dropping serve five times in the opening two sets but recovered to claim a memorable win. The four-hour-long slugfest saw Norrie save two match points in a contest that set a US Open record of 58 break points. In an all-American clash on Armstrong, Steve Johnson beat 16th-seeded John Isner 6-7, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3, 7-6 in another five-setter.  ",sports

"Here to play cricket, not have fun; hope everyone understands that: Kohli on IPL bio-bubble","  India and Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli understands ""the privilege"" of being able to play cricket in the middle of a raging pandemic and he wants all IPL participants to respect the tournament's bio-secure bubble. Speaking on RCB's Youtube show 'Bold Diaries', the 31-year-old swashbuckler said he didn't exactly miss the game during the COVID-forced lockdown, which brought sporting action to a halt. ""Maybe because I was going on day and night for the last 10 years...It was a revelation for me in the sense that my focus was not solely on missing the game all the time,"" Kohli said. Now that he is gearing up to be back in action with the IPL, starting September 19 in the UAE, Kohli said the BCCI's Standard Operating Procedure and the bio-bubble restrictions should be non-negotiable for all participants. ""We are all here to play cricket...The bio-bubble needs to be respected at all times for the tournament to happen eventually. We are not here to have fun and roam around and you know say that 'I want to hang out in Dubai',"" Kohli asserted. ""That is not the time we are living in. Accept the phase that we are going through and understand the privilege that we have, just to be a part of the IPL. Everyone should accept that and not behave in a manner which situation doesn't require them to,"" he said. Speaking about coming back to the game after five months, Kohli said it didn't take much time for him to find his groove. ""A couple of months back you couldn't imagine that you will have IPL firstly... When we had our practice session yesterday, I realised how long it has been. When I was heading to the practice session, I felt nervous,"" he conceded. ""I felt a bit jittery but things were okay. I didn't miss the game as much as I though I might...just carrying on with life was also important,"" he said. Kohli credited the side's support staff, led by Team Director Mike Hesson, for making everyone understand what's at stake and at the same time, not put them under pressure. ""Culture will not change for any individual preferences,"" he said. On the the tournament being played without in-stadia fans because of the bio-bubble restrictions, Kohli said it would be strange at first but eventually players will adapt to the feeling. ""I would not say it won't be difficult, strange. The echo of bat hitting the ball, I haven't experienced it for the last 10 years. The Ranji Trophy was the last time. But we have done this at some stage of our lives,"" he said referring to the domestic games which are played in near-empty venues. ""The crowd factor will definitely play a part but the instincts will kick in and it will diminish quite quickly."" Also, the instinctive celebrations on the field will also be restricted due to health-safety protocols. Kohli reiterated that everyone has no choice but to adapt. ""It has to be a balance. You cannot go berserk. We can't be like kids being sent to a park,"" he quipped. The star cricketer, who will welcome his first child in January with actor wife Anushka Sharma, said he has been over the moon ever since he got to know about it. ""It is an incredible feeling. It puts things in perspective for you. It is difficult to describe how you feel,"" he said.

Cong protests against ‘anti-farmer Bills’,"  Hundreds of Congress workers held a demonstration at Parliament House on Monday against the “anti-farmer” Bills passed by Rajya Sabha despite the strident objection by opposition parties. The party workers led by Congress  Delhi unit president Anil Kumar marched towards the Parliament from Ambedkar International Bhawan, shouting anti-BJP slogans. Delhi Police detained the protestors at Mandir Marg Police Station. Kumar said that the Modi Government is foisting anti-farmer bills on the cultivators that will further destroy the farmers who are already reeling under tremendous financial stress due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The centre has crushed the voice of the farmers with the passage of the bills in a dictatorial manner in Parliament without even considering the opinions of the main opposition party and others,” he said. He said that the Modi Government has snatched away the farmers’ freedom to sell their products at competitive prices, with a ‘Minimum Support Price’ (MSP) assured and to give the private players a free run. Kumar said that the Delhi Congress will continue to forcefully raise the voice of the farmers till the anti-farmer bills are withdrawn. “Ever since the Modi Government came to power at the Centre, its one-point agenda has been to help its rich friends fatten their pockets at the cost of the poor. The Congress will not be mute spectators to such anti-people moves by the BJP Government,” he said. The Congress president wondered why the Aam Aadmi Party Government was keeping a loud silence on the anti-farmer bills. “Only “six farmers have benefited from AAP’s much-touted plan to increase MSP. The farmers of Delhi say that they are being forced to sell their wheat at prices lower than even the MSP of the Central and this is in stark contrast to the announcements made by the Arvind Government last year when it had announced the “Mukhyamantri Kisan Mitra Yojna”. Under this scheme, around 20,000 farmers in Delhi were to benefit from MSP which was higher than that set by the Centre, but  the Delhi farmers never really benefited from this scheme,” he added.

Labelling exaggerates people’s mental health problems,"  The recent stories going around about the untimely demise of a famous film star in Mumbai has raised many eyebrows about various mental health issues prevalent in people. Some say he was depressed, some label him bipolar while many say he had severe anxiety. Others say that he was a drug addict and many concluded that he may have committed suicide. Some have imagined an altogether different story of jealousy and homicide. The case is being investigated by the authorities so let us wait for the results and not let our imagination run riot. I wish to make it very clear here that the mental health issues of any person should be diagnosed by a doctor who is fully qualified and eligible to do so- nobody else should discuss and label people as depressed, bipolar or suicidal, or use medical terminology lightly. It is unethical to do so and it is also a waste of your and others time to participate in such discussions on subject on which they have no authentic knowledge because they are not qualified to do so.  I want to make it very clear again that no one whether it be a friend, family, media or any other novice other than a doctor has any authority, claim or qualification to do so. Mental health issues are as common as physical health issues today. It has been researched that one in every four people we meet suffer from a mental health problem. We readily go to a doctor to get treated for our physical ailments. Similarly, we should not hesitate to go and get our mental health issues also checked and treated by a doctor or a mental health professional. The good news is that most mental health issues are treatable with medications and psychotherapy also helps. By calling someone mad or depressed we are labelling them and this is stigma. Do we ever call anyone by names like-- fever or pneumonia--when they suffer from them? Then why call someone mental or depressed? Many television debates are today discussing the mental health status of some deceased cine stars and it’s a waste of time to do so as they have no qualification or knowledge to discuss this. In such cases they are just confused and confusing the viewers about something they have no knowledge about. Moreover by such discussions we add fuel to fire –we stigmatise the person and thereby make him an object of ridicule and pity and the family may abandon him and thus aggravate his condition. Discussions on various platforms on topics like ‘can a depressed person commit suicide’, ‘was he or she depressed or bipolar’ and showing their video clips and analysing and diagnosing their behaviour on screen is not ethically correct. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea to diagnose or comment on someone’s mental health status –let the qualified doctor do so please. Here are some mental health problems we should be aware of and take a doctor’s help to get them diagnosed and treated. There is a vast difference between psychosis and neurosis and it’s a doctor’s prerogative to diagnose and treat accordingly. Stress: Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It is defined as the degree to which you feel overwhelmed or unable to cope as a result of pressures that are unmanageable. It is shown in our behaviours when we are angry irritated or frustrated. It can also manifest as headaches. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry or nervous. Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline.When this stress increases in magnitude it becomes distress which is hazardous to our emotional, physical and mental wellbeing. Depression:  If a person has four or more of the following or similar symptoms, for more than two weeks, consult a doctor or mental health professional right away. He will diagnose whether you may or may not have a major or a minor depressive episode. The symptoms are persistent sad or “empty” mood; feeling hopeless, helpless, worthless, pessimistic and/or guilty; substance abuse; fatigue or loss of interest in ordinary activities, including sex; disturbances in eating and sleeping patterns; irritability, increased crying, anxiety or panic attacks; difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions; thoughts of suicide; suicide plans or attempts; persistent physical symptoms or pains that do not respond to treatment. Bipolar disorder: Formerly called manic depression, it is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. The exact cause of bipolar disorder isn’t known, but a combination of genetics, environment and altered brain structure and chemistry may play a role. Manic episodes may include symptoms such as high energy, reduced need for sleep and loss of touch with reality. Depressive episodes may include symptoms such as low energy, low motivation and loss of interest in daily activities. Mood episodes last days to months at a time and may also be associated with suicidal thoughts. Anxiety disorder: A mental health disorder characterised by feelings of worry, anxiety or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities. Examples of anxiety disorders include panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Symptoms include stress that's out of proportion to the impact of the event, inability to set aside a worry and restlessness Substance abuse: Excessive use of psychoactive drugs such as alcohol, pain medications or illegal drugs can lead to physical, social or emotional harm.

MCD to send notices to telecom companies flouting rules,"  The Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) will issue notices to private telecommunications companies this week for the installation of poles besides using electricity poles in the city without the permission of the corporation. Apart from this, the corporation also passed the proposal to float tender for door to door collection in the selected 21 new wards. In the executive committee meeting presided over by mayor Sunil Uniyal 'Gama' on Monday, the members discussed and passed several proposals including those which were delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The councillors introduced a major issue in the meeting about the telecommunication companies stating that there is an illegal installation of poles and use of electricity poles in several wards of the city. According to them, some telecommunication companies have paid about Rs 20 crore to the power corporation but they are using poles erected by MCD without a No objection Certificate (NOC). Taking cognisance of the matter, municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey instructed officials concerned to issue notices to all such companies operating without NOC from MCD. Meanwhile, the mayor also proposed to discuss four advertising agencies which were supposed to pay the corporation over Rs two crore from April to September but the agencies have asked MCD to give them relaxation as they have collectively earned only about Rs 30 lakh since April. However, no final decision was taken in this matter. Further, focusing on the ways through which MCD can generate more revenue in future, Gama stated that the tender for 10 wedding points and 19 smart vending zones will be done with immediate effect. He asked all councillors to verify the selected places for the construction of smart vending zones in their respective wards and if they find any issue with the sites, they must inform the corporation within one week. Besides this, the issue of the sanitation in the new wards was also discussed in the meeting. According to the municipal commissioner, the corporation wanted to provide sanitation facilities including door to door collection of waste like in 69 wards but MCD had the budget of Rs five crore only which was insufficient for the remaining 31 wards. Therefore, the corporation approached HDFC bank which agreed to fund the sanitation facilities in four wards under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) which they will possibly start from October 2, as per Pandey. He further informed that the sanitation facilities in five wards are being provided by a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Waste Warriors and in one ward by Feedback Foundation.  Excluding these 10 wards, the budget of the corporation for the sanitation facilities of the remaining 21 wards falls under Rs five crore, therefore MCD will soon invite tender for the same, added Pandey. Besides this, the members also proposed survey of the street vendors besides vegetable vendors so that they can also benefit from Prime Minister Svanidhi Scheme through which they can get a loan of Rs 10,000. As stated by Pandey, ""We have the data of only vegetable and fruit street vendors through the survey of the year 2016. About 2,700 such vendors are registered with MCD and recently 835 vendors wanted loans under this scheme."" He added that this scheme can benefit other street vendors too like cobblers, therefore the corporation will complete the survey of all such street vendors within 15 days. Meanwhile, Gama stated that to increase the revenue of the corporation, the MCD will also provide 100 milk booths to Aanchal Dairy. The corporation is also planning to provide employment to at least 10,000 locals through various projects like wedding points and vending zones among others which will increase the earnings of MCD too, he claimed.

The CM in his strong message to agitating policemen and Opposition members said that the State Government is not going to tolerate arrogance and wrong practices of the protesting policemen. He said the Government has not initiated strict action against agitating policemen but Government’s patience should not be tested. Soren also feared apprehension of the spread of corona pandemic due to dharna of assistant policemen. After the Chief Minister’s remark, senior BJP leader and former Minister CP Singh attacking the Soren Government said you have got the Government for not issuing orders for lathicharge on assistant policemen. Replying to Chief Minister remark that BJP lawmakers are instigating assistant policemen, Singh said, “BJP MLAs are going to Morhabadi ground for morning walk and not for instigating policemen.” Former Deputy Chief Minister and Silli legislator Sudesh Mahto said if the Chief Minister is so much concerned about spread of corona pandemic due to dharna of policemen then he should personally visit the agitating assistant policemen to end the deadlock.

Punjab to implement e-challaning throughout State,"  All set to take a digital leap, Punjab Government will soon implement the e-challaning system across the state, besides providing options to make payment through digital gateways, and holding virtual courts for traffic offenders. Punjab Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Traffic, Sharad Satya Chauhan, during a webinar on ‘Traffic Management and Road Safety under the COVID-19 Pandemic’ on Monday, emphasized on contactless and digital methods of policing like e-challan system, single use of straw while checking for drunk and drive, and digi locker platform for checking documents. Chauhan said that the Punjab Police is looking forward to implement e-challaning system throughout the state after a successful pilot project in SAS Nagar and Patiala through which a greater number of offenders can be fined for violation of traffic rules. “Through the corporate social responsibility (CSR), enough machines would be procured so that the entire state can be brought to a digital platform and all challans would be made through machines,” he said. Sharing details, he said that the payments would be made through digital gateways. The records generated would help the Punjab police to remain strict on repeat offenders and even cancel their licences, he said. Talking about the ‘virtual courts’ for traffic offenders — an initiative by the Supreme Court, Chauhan said that with the help of the courts, Ludhiana can be taken up as a project where digital challans generated from the control room by automatic cameras would be sent to the virtual courts where e-summons can be given to offenders on the phone and they can pay the fine through digital gateways attached to the virtual courts. Elaborating further, Chauhan said that this would be the new addition to the challaning process and quick redressal to the problem which can be processed through digital mode. He also talked about the new training paradigm and methods of enforcement with instructions to traffic police personnel. To bridge the gap between Police and the citizens of Punjab through the use of digital platforms, Punjab Police and Safety Alliance for Everyone (SAFE) Society has organized the webinar — first of its kind in the country under ‘Safe Punjab Programme’. “COVID-19 pandemic has restricted the Punjab Police to interact in person with the citizens of the state while keeping them unaware about the practices adopted by Punjab Police,” said the ADGP Traffic.

PM Modi likely to inaugurate Atal tunnel on Oct 3: Himachal CM,"  Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate Atal tunnel on Leh-Manali highway in Himachal Pradesh’s Rohtang on October 3. “According to the Prime Minister’s tentative programme, he will come to Manali on October 3 for inaugurating the tunnel and will also visit Lahaul,” said Himachal Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur while talking to the mediapersons here. The Chief Minister said that it is not yet decided if the Prime Minister will address a public rally in Lahaul that day. The Rohtang tunnel has been named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had announced the project on June 3, 2000. The work to build it was entrusted to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). The 9.2-km tunnel is the world’s longest above an altitude of 3,000 metres and will reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km. The tribal district of Lahaul-Spiti which remains cut off for six months due to heavy snowfall at Rohtang Pass, is expected to benefit from the tunnel’s construction.

"Ram Rajya envisages spirit of fraternity, justice","  The Covid-19 epidemic will leave a lasting impression on the mankind about how lives of poor or rich, privileged or underprivileged, powerful or powerless became vulnerable, helpless and unsecured before it. Neither technology nor social status, not even wealth could pose any threat to this virus.  This is bound to lead the humans to burry divisiveness and hatred to secure a new world order of fraternity, generating fellow feeling and mutual care beyond national boundaries to overcome such global challenges. India’s ancient civilization wisdom conceives world as one family which in past sheltered people of different faiths. In the Ramayana, Jatayu, the divine bird, knew that it cannot fight with Ravana to release Sita from his clutch; still he fought and laid his life in a show of fraternity. In return,  Rama performed the funeral rituals of the bird as a mark of his gratefulness. Are humans now showing such fellow feeling and gratefulness? Lord Ram himself lived in simplicity and followed path of probity, justice and well being of all lives and created numerous such examples.  It is said that he punished a saint for hitting a dog, on the latter’s complaint. Vendetta reigns today’s political world. Everybody thinks he is right and others are wrong. Any dissent is treated inimical and the adversary looked down as enemy.  Great saint and freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak criticised highhandedness of the British Government in the name of containing plague in Pune in his paper Keshari and in return was threatened by the British authorities to which he wrote back in his paper “governance does not mean taking revenge” which led to his arrest in July 1897 in Mumbai under sedition law. Post independence, the Governments still adopt the same sedition law to intimidate political rivals. Tilakji, Gandhiji, Netaji and countless men and women met unbearable suffering to free the country from the foreign rule. The founding fathers of the constitution giving the country a republican polity, guaranteed fundamental rights. They were foresighted incorporating “fraternity” along with justice, liberty and equality in the preamble, to cultivate the spirit of fraternity at all spheres of life. Leaders during freedom struggle were a synthesis of multiple ideas, tolerant of opposite opinions and it nourished relations above party and ideological differences. Netaji Subash Chandra Bose during his second tenure as  Congress president could not constitute the AICC due to non-cooperation by some supporters of Gandhiji and hence resigned from the presidentship in April, 1939. But this never diminished his respect to Gandhiji and during INA days in his broadcast to Indian people from abroad, he addressed Gandhiji as father of nation and named one of INA regiments as Gandhi regiment. Gandhiji never reduced his admiration to Netaji in spite of ideological differences with him about mode of freedom struggle.  Netaji had a great feeling of fraternity also. I was once told by freedom fighter Jagganath Mishra that prior to Netaji’s disappearance from the country, Dibakar Patnaik and he had gone to meet him at his Kolkata residence when after brief discussion both went to take a round of the city and returned late night till which Netaji was waiting at his front varanda to take dinner with them. Supporters of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Gokhle virtually had come to blows in Surat session in 1907 on an ultimatum resolution to be served to British but both jointly worked to strengthen freedom struggle irrespective of differences. According to some authors, Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was critical of Gandhiji about the manner on uplift of Harijans but Gandhiji advised Pandit Nehru to take him in his cabinet.  Pandit Nehru and Dr Rajendra Prasad differed at many issues. As a true democrat, Pandit Nehru accepted Dr Rajendra Prasad for the office of president of India, when his suggestion for another leader to the high office was reportedly turned down in the Congress meeting. Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, the veteran socialist leader, was a strong critic of Pandit Nehru. I was once told by a veteran leader that Dr Lohia had written a letter to Prime Minister Nehru but did not get any reply. Subsequently when both met on some occasion Dr Lohia enquired about it and Pandit Nehru instantly cross checked with his PA, who agreed about the receipt of the letter which he had not taken to his notice. Pandit Nehru became furious on his staff on this and asked the person concerned to apologize to Dr Lohia.Gandhiji demonstrated humbleness and led a simple life as he was very much sad about poverty in the society. On the contrary, many in positions prefer to adopt luxurious living to show a distinct. I recall one incident probably in the year 1980 how former CM Naba Krushna Choudhary was carrying his own luggage alighting from a train at Bhubaneswar station while moving to catch a riksha when I was waiting at Bhubaneswar railway station along with former Union Minister Samarandra Kundu to travel to Puri to attend a HMS meeting. Kundu asked me to immediately lift the luggage from his shoulder which I did; when I found that he was none but the great Gandhian Naba Krushna Choudhary.  During his tenure as CM, Biju Patnaik decided to support a Congress leader for Rajya Sabha to facilitate his continuance as a Minister of State for railway as mark of fraternity and in the interest of the State. On several occasions, Bijubabu used to tell to keep Panchayat elections above politics to safeguard the traditional fraternity in the society. Gandhiji’s dream of “Rama Rajya” conceived “Swarajya” underlining sovereignty with people to transform villages as self reliant units both politically and economically limiting the role of rulers as trustees in the governance mechanism. After independence some of the national parties have used the Rama Rajya concept as a vote catching slogan.  Loving every life including people of other faiths, respecting adversaries, becoming judicious and achieving equality among citizens is essential to fulfill the goals of Ram Rajya. In Ram Rajya, “deception” and “hypocrisy” had no place. (The writer is a former Odisha Assembly Deputy Speaker. Phone: 9437412877; E-mail: pandarcp@gmail.com.

‘Open defunct spinning mills to employ migrants',"  Samajwadi Party State president Rabi Behera has urged CM Naveen Patnaik to initiate action for for opening the OTM (Odisha Textile Mills) at Choudwar, Aska Spinning Mill, Khordha Spinning Mill, Sarala Spinning Mill, Tirtol and Baliapal Spinning Mill, Baleswar to provide  employment opportunity to the workers.

Fear or love: What guides our action during corona?,"  Every action of ours is driven either by fear or by love. We work either for the love of it or for the fear of survival. One can identify fear or love that guides action and response. This is not only true for our faith in God but for our life events as well. Some worship God because they are devoted and some others worship God because they are just afraid of Him. They fear that if the God is enraged, losses for them are inevitable. Some don’t fall into any category. Even as this insidious coronavirus is taking a massive toll of humanity, our actions are determined by fear or devotion (Bhay or Bhakti). Interestingly, both factors here are governed by the fact that the origin of the virus is not ascertained; and there are various stories on its date and place of origin. It affects all irrespective of boundary, age, profession, class and so on.  There is no cure discovered to treat this virus. And there are a lot of theories on immunity, temperature and openness of democracy. Uncertainties related to the pandemic and its aftereffects bring both the factors at play.Fear: Most of us abided by the advisories of the Government for lockdown because we were afraid that we are not immortal. We wanted to keep us and our families safe. Even the coercion by the Government to enforce lockdown for the common good is feared, making people stay back in their homes. We are definitely more informed and educated to fight the virus; and this information or lack of correct information and the plethora of fake news keep the fear intact. The lethal combination of an interconnected world and a deadly virus taking humanity to uncharted quarters keeps the pace going. Most developed nations and progressive regional organisations were clueless when the virus started and continued spreading like wildfire. Devotion: Most of those staying back at home even now want to keep their region and country safe. Nobody wants to be the super-spreader. Some have had to make impulsive decisions to reach their native territories, but it can be blamed on poverty or homesickness.But these two factors, one more than other, at play had kept 1.3 crore people or a majority of them indoors and now adopting the new normal. One more question springs from here: Is the state becoming the last refuge for the citizens with its power, legitimacy and surveillance technologies that have been losing control due to global economic forces. Only time can tell. (Dr Samanta is MP, Kandhamal, and founder, KIIT & KISS)  ",state-editions

Interview of the week,"  It’s a fight against public schools’ exorbitant fees Basudev Bhatta is a social activists and a whistleblower. After his graduation from the BJB College in 1994, he took to social work wherein he found great delight.  A Good Samaritan, he had served cyclone and flood-affected people of Puri and Cuttack districts and reached out to people of Erasama and Paradip during the 1999 Super Cyclone leading various student and youth groups. Now as a Rotarian, he is coming to the aid of heart and cancer patients. He is also the chairperson of Odisha Avibhabak Mahasangha (OAM) engaged in shielding the rights of parents, guardians and students as and when needed.  The huge hiatus between the public schools fee structures and the capacity of the common man have shocked him, for which he is revolting against such exploitation. In an interview to The Pioneer, Bhatta spoke to Sugyan Choudhury on the ills afflicting our education system. When was the Odisha Avibhabak Mahasangha formed and how many are its members? It was constituted in the year 2015-16 and as many as 35,000 parents and guardians are its members. It is constituted to protect and defend the rights of parents and their children. We achieved a great success while fighting against the arbitrary actions of the CBSE when it expelled 13,500 students from Odisha. We took the leadership at the national level. Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar and Dharmendra Pradhan and our Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik intervened in the issue and it was solved. The OAM has its branches in all 30 districts of Odisha. We have medical, engineering and pharmacy students’ wings too. We are connected by 120 WhatsApp groups. What is the reason of our educational system still remaining moribund? The Indira Gandhi Government had introduced a national education policy in 1968. The Kothari Commissioner had submitted a detailed report to streamline the educational system; and the report is so holistic in nature that no second commission was needed. But no substantial improvement has been done so far due to non- implementation of this report. In 1986, the Rajiv Gandhi Government introduce the next education policy that had a vision like Black Board Operation, open university system and quality education for the deprived sections of students including SC,ST, but nothing has yet been done so far. In 2019, the Modi Government has introduced a new education policy under the chairmanship of K Kasturi Nandan, former ISRO chief. But what is revealing is that only 4% of the nation’s GDP is utilised towards improvements of education. How then could then we hope for quality education? Everywhere in Odisha and in India, there is violation of Article 21(A) of the Constitution. We are happy that the OAM as a potential organisation is all poised to fight a battle for realisation of our Constitutional rights in the education system. Do you think the Right to Education (RTE) Act with 25% reservation has been implemented in Odisha? In 2002, the Vajpayee Government had amended Article 21 (A) making the provision for free and compulsory education for children from 6 years to 14 years. In 2009, the UPA Government under Manmohan Singh amended the Act and it was introduced in the year 2010 in Odisha. But only 50% of the implementation has been done with the other 50% of the RTE Act drawing a blank so far. We have been fighting hard over the last two years for implementation of 25% reservation meant for Disadvantaged Group (DG 10%) and Economically Weaker Section (15%). Previous ministers and bureaucrats have failed. This time, we are glad that a dynamic officer like Satyabrata Sahu, Commissioner-cum-Secretary, has taken a very firm decision towards the RTE implementation from this year.  Consequently, there will be an online system for admission to schools. You have a choice of a numbers of schools before you. This way, as many as 60,000 students of Odisha belonging to DG group and weaker section shall get free education. What are the RTE violations you have come across in public schools? The glaring example of RTE violations of humongous magnitude have been perpetuated amounting to around Rs 300 crore over the last decade by the DAV Schools’ managements, which have sold the vacant seats meant for the Disadvantaged Group and weaker sections (total 25%) for each seat  extracting to the tune of Rs 4 to 5 lakh on the management quota. We have moved the Government in this regard and filed a case. The second corruption of DAV Schools is that they are taking Rs 2 lakh from each student for readmission to Std-XI  after the Std-X examination, which is highly illegal. If the student is of the same school then while taking admission in the Std-XI they can only make a hike of 8% over the last year fees. The OAM shall fight against it in all possible ways, including legal battle. We have started a movement against arbitrary enhancement of school fees by private managements. There are 57 DAV Public Schools in Odisha which have enhanced their fees exorbitantly. We have moved court, which has appointed Justice KP Mohapatra commission of inquiry which has already submitted its report to the State Government. There have been allegations against huge exploitations by the DAV Schools since they have byelaws of their own.  If a student pays a huge amount to ttake admission in LKG then in the subsequent years what is the need for readmission? Then they are charging development fees, reconstruction fees, day boarding fees, transportation fees and the like. It is understood that the DAV Schools have enhanced their fees by 35% each year. Some schools like Narayani, Xavier and some DAV schools of Sundargarh, Rourkela, Sambalpur, Talcher, Kanhia have gone to enhance their fees by 37%. We have raised the compliant to the District Magistrates and the Government and, accordingly, a committee under chairmanship of Director, Secondary Education was constituted for determining the fee structures of the private schools. Finally, it was agreed upon by all parties, including the OAM, that 8% of hike in fees shall be made considering 2016-17 as the base year. During the Covid pandemic, there are no school activities over the last seven months. The OAM have moved the High Court to waive all fees on the line “No school, no fees” and the court’s judgement is expected on September 22. Earlier, the court had directed the Government for an amicable settlement and, accordingly, all parties have signed an MoU with the Government under the chairmanship of Commissioner-cum- Secretary, School and Mass Education, and the matter was submitted to the High Court.

Cong pits Pilot against Scindia in Gwalior-Chambal in MP bypolls,"  The upcoming bypolls in Madhya Pradesh would witness former Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot against Jyotiraditya Scindia at least in 16 Assembly constituencies falling in Gwalior-Chambal region. Bypolls are scheduled in 28 constituencies of Madhya Pradesh. There are 16 constituency of Scindia influence. There are 14 Ministers in Shivraj Singh Chouhan Cabinet, who are not MLAs. They include 11 Scindia supporters. While the BJP and Scindia have already launched election campaign, the Congress has adopted a multipronged strategy to settle the Pilot question hounding it since the July-August 2020 rebellion. Party sources said on the initiative of PCC Chief and former Chief Minister Kamal Nath, Pilot has agreed to campaign against his old friend Scindia. After Pilot had defected from the Congress, it would be a new assignment for him to prove his loyalty to the party. In March this year, Scindia had walked away from the Congress making 22 MLAs resign from their seats, which brought down the Kamal Nath regime barely 15 months after it had come to power in the State. Three more Congress MLAs defected and the death of three sitting MLAs are necessitating the by-polls, which are likely to be held in later half of October. MPCC Spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said Pilot’s strength in these regions is the presence of Gujjar voters and the former Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister’s ability to deliver punchlines. He certainly has influence in the bordering constituencies, he added.  ",state-editions

Verma said that from September 23 to 30 the doctors would boycott the OPDs. The association would decide on its future strategy on September 30.  ",state-editions

Societies take steps to beat Coronavirus,"  With no let-up in Covid-19 cases, various residential societies across the city-NCR  are not letting their guard down. They have stepped up the measures to ensure safety of their member residents, domestic help, security staff as well as delivery agents who enter the premises to deliver food or shopping orders as the fear of virus spread remains amid the gradual opening up of the economy.  “These are testing times. People have started moving out. At our society, we have ensured all safety precautions against Coronavirus, such as restricted entry of visitors, thermal check at society gate, daily sanitisation of society common areas, lift and elevators. We have set up wash basins at the gate for visitors to wash their hands before they enter the society. “Members are being regularly informed of guidelines through the WhatsApp groups,”  said Sunita Tewatia, President of the Maurya Society at IP Extension here. While delivery boys are not allowed to enter the premises, members have been asked not to hold social functions and gathering till the situation normalises, she said. The Union Health Ministry  has already issued guidelines for the gated societies enlisting steps on how to maintain high standards of personal hygiene to safeguard their health. Suchitra K Mohanty, resident of Galaxy Vega Society in Noida Extension said “ We have ensured all safety measures like sanitation, thermal scanning of all those entering the society, fugmintation of all lifts, switches, common areas and susceptible areas on the regular basis.  The society staff has been given masks and gloves for their safety.” According to Saurabh Rathore,  a resident of SG Impression, Sector 4 Vashundhara,  “All the security guards, visitors, maids and vendors have been strictly asked to wash their hands properly for at least 20 seconds.

‘Govt misleading people with data on employment’,"  Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Uttar Pradesh government of misleading people with the data on employment released to the media.  Yadav on Sunday said that in the data on employment, the BJP government also included the jobs given during the previous Samajwadi Party regime. The UP government had earlier released data of jobs given to youth during its three-and-half year rule of the present dispensation. The SP president said the data included most of the people employed on contractual basis and asked how could the government claim it to be an achievement. The SP chief alleged that the figures on employment released by the state government were false and the sole aim of the government was to mislead the people. He said 90 per cent of the vacancies filled in Medical Health and Family Welfare departments were by contract or outsourcing. “In the National Health Mission, 100 per cent recruitment is contractual. Why does the government consider outsourcing and contract jobs as an achievement?” he asked. “Why does the government not provide details of outsourcing, contractual recruitments and permanent jobs? The recruitments done by the Subordinate Selection Service Commission and Public Service Commission are the ones whose results came in 2017 during the Samajwadi Party regime. The government also added this to its achievements. Why is the Bharatiya Janata Party government describing the recruitments made during Samajwadi Party regime as its achievement,” Yadav said. However, countering the attack, the Bharatiya Janata Party claimed that its government had given more jobs in just three-and-half years than the Samajwadi Party or Bahujan Samaj Party could give in five years. It also claimed to have provided employment to more than three lakh people in the state, whereas, over one-and-half crore jobs were provided during the COVID-19-induced lockdown. Earlier, in a meeting with officers of the Recruitment Board on Friday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had asked government departments to furnish details of all vacant posts. He had also directed recruitment agencies to fill up the vacancies within the next three months and give appointment letters to the applicants within six months. BJP state vice-president and MLC Vijay Bahadur Pathak had said that the Yogi Adityanath-led government was the first to go for such a large-scale recruitment against the vacancies in the government departments.

Yogi welcomes farmers’ bills ... says it will bring change in farm sector,"  Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has welcomed the two farmers-friendly bills — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 —passed by Parliament and said they would bring about wide-ranging changes in agriculture sector. Yogi said these bills reflected Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s resolve to ensure welfare of the farmers . “I thank the prime minister for this public welfare endeavour. The provisions of these bills will herald a new era in the agriculture sector,” he said. Describing it as a unique and historic step of the prime minister, the chief minister said that both the bills favoured farmers and the agriculture sector as a whole. He said they would help in increasing the incomes of farmers' manifold. “The provisions of these bills will free the farmers from unnecessary legislation, bring fundamental changes in the agriculture sector, give impetus to investment in the farm sector and increase employment. It will favourably affect the agricultural economy which in turn will strengthen the economy of the country,” Yogi said. The chief minister said that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 would promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce. “This will create an ecosystem where the farmers and traders can enjoy freedom of choice of sale and purchase of agri-produce,” he said. Echoing the commitment of the prime minister to double the income of farmers, the chief minister said that this bill was entirely in the favour of the farmer community. “It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who brought about a historical and unprecedented increase in minimum support price (MSP) and ensured the right price to farmers of their produce in a speedy and transparent manner,” he added. Hitting out at the opposition parties, Yogi said while the Central and the state governments were busy fulfilling their commitment to ensuring fair price to farmers for their produce, certain political parties were showing their mala fide intentions by making misleading statements. He appealed to farmers to not be misled by these political entities which were the same that considered farmers only as a vote bank for the last six-seven decades without ever caring for their welfare. “The state government is also striving hard to double the income of the farmers and was following the guidance of the prime minister to achieve this. The state government has taken several policy decisions for agriculture and farmers’ welfare,” he said. Elaborating on the initiatives of the UP government, he said that during lockdown, the state government exempted 45 items of fruits and vegetables from mandi tax fee which benefited the farmers directly. “Now the farmers are free to sell their fruits and vegetables anywhere in the state,” he said. The chief minister said that the reforms brought by the Central government would favourably impact the farmers. “The farmers will no longer be bound to sell their produce in the Mandi premises. From now onwards, they may sell their produce from warehouse, cold storage or food processing units instead of notified mandis only. Not only this, they can sell the produce to traders/food processing units at farm gates at a right price. This will save transportation and freight charges as well,” he said. Yogi said that the promotion of contract farming would help the farmers reach an agreement with the food processing units/exporters on individual or organised basis. “This will enable them to reduce fertiliser, seed and other inputs’ costs and use modern techniques to maximise their products and get a better market. This will also help the farmer work according to national-international demands,” he said.  ",state-editions
Bhandarkar meets CM; discusses film city,"  After Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced that the Uttar Pradesh government would set up the country’s biggest film city in the state, director Madhur Bhandarkar on Sunday met him and discussed the proposed film city in UP.

Earlier, while announcing the new film city near Noida, the chief minister on Friday last had said that his government would make the country’s biggest and beautiful film city either in Noida, Greater Noida or on the Yamuna Expressway. The chief minister has asked the officials concerned to select the place and go ahead with the new film city and develop it in a fast track process. After the announcement of the film city, actor Kangana Ranaut had thanked Yogi Adityanath for his move and hoped that it would boost the film industry, including Hollywood, which would be attracted towards India. Bharatiya Janata Party MP and Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan said that the new film city would boost employment and the youth would get an opportunity to showcase their talents. Singer and BJP MP Manoj Tiwari too said that the new film city would boost development in north India and it would develop the film industry in the region.

"Tinsel town, political world have equally shocking dark secrets","  Any domain of human activity or profession has inherent issues most of which are not popularly available for public knowledge or consumption. Ordinary people anywhere are simple and gullible. They are easily moved and shaken up by creatures that are engaged in the world of false, outwardly glamour. The movie world is, therefore, called the tinsel town. Recently, a young rising actor died in mysterious circumstances. His controversial girlfriend and other linked acquaintances are in trouble mainly because they have been found to be habitual narcotic substance users. Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide as per preliminary police investigations. Family and fans screamed ‘Murder!’ But police failed to sniff homicide.  A nationwide frenzied cry provoked courts to put the CBI to investigate the matter though by now, they have not been able to see much success. However they picked the drug link. So, the Narcotic Control Bureau came over and nabbed ‘girlfriend', her brother and some more associates.  Bollywood biggies, hitherto worshipped, are being exposed as mindless drug users and sinners for having engaged in nepotism to ensure own people rise and the real talented ones vanish into oblivion. Not so long ago, late Praveen Babi was used by many men including stars, directors, financers and producers to get her some fame and money by organising roles in movies. Ultimately, her life became miserable. Eventually, she died of loneliness-induced depression. She lived her last days on alcohol and drugs. Then there were the underworld dons like Dawood Ibrahim who financed big movies to force their actors and actresses on producers. Three established directors were told sternly that they would be killed if they ignored artist recommendations. Gulshan Kumar, the music mughal, was killed for not coughing out protection money and discarding two music directors Nadeem and Shravan.There are quite a few Bollywood wolves that keep nurturing the flesh industry by fleecing gullible girls into immoral activities that encourage the casting couch and the flesh-crazy vultures to have a good time. The political domain is equally bad in India. The immoral and devilish creatures in power politics too are known to be doing any sinister things without being exposed. Political aspirants have to bribe decision-making crooks for election tickets and positions of authority. Scruples are considered inconsequential by a majority of politicians. The aspiring ones find it extremely easy to bribe their way to the top. It was big story not very long ago that a small-time politician used to run a ‘land encroachment business' by only keeping happy the powerful ones in politics. He managed to remain out of jail.  Political patronage made it possible for him to own a revolver and having two private armed guards. When his business grew bigger, he felt the need to become a ‘power politician' himself. They offered him the rank of a Gram Pradhan for a token sum of one million rupees. This was in the year 2009. He in return provided local goons for his mentors whenever they required them for rallies. He also organised grand alcohol-soaked stag parties for perpetually thirsty-hungry senior leaders who were ‘saintly glamorous' in public eyes. This crook once revealed that a rank higher than his had to dish out five million rupees to become a Zila Prabhari. The amount quadrupled for every higher rank. That’s how one gets to see a petty businessman becoming a political figure overnight! Interestingly, the Railways portfolio is a high-priced take in Indian politics. The Ministry had a separate Budget until 2014. The practice was stopped by the BJP Government by Suresh Prabhu when he became Railways boss. Significantly, the Railways is the biggest employer in India. And since the railways are considered the lifeline of the nation, merely by declaring a few new trains to run, a political creature can ensure huge votes in his constituency. Even PM Modi played the same trick by starting a Mumbai-Ahmedabad superfast train. A big number of politicians have been caught in acts of scandalous sex. There have been numerous incidences of politicians getting caught while watching pornography during the lawmaking sessions. The same crooks have been known for vehemently demanding a ban on porn sites and adult TV channels!  Incidentally, when India started making movies, no woman came forward to act. Men, including legendary Pran, played female roles. Devika Rani was the first female to play a role. She did a bold kissing scene those days. But Prime Minister Nehru ordered deletion of the entire scene despite him being a progressive, western-trained gentleman.There was this scandalous news of a secret phone conversation between actress Bipasha Basu and UP politician Amar Singh. But subsequent forensic test proved it was fake and the insiders said the test report was manipulated.  Amar Singh was once upon a time considered the ablest of political pimps who could pull any job involving top politicians, movie stars and businessmen during the 1990s. It was Singh who brought actress Jayaprada into UP politics. Jayaprada, who had failed to make dent in Andhra Pradesh as a politician, was elected from Rampur because of Amar Singh. Azam Khan and Amar Singh fell out in the party. Jayaprada later accused Azam Khan of circulating her fake nude photos. The news remained insignificant and no one cared to know more as she had become an elderly woman by then. But having borne a grudge from those days, during the general elections of 2019, Azam Khan gave a vulgar statement about Jayaprada: “I have seen which colour of underwear she wears.” Jayaprada did not react much, and the people cared a damn as her  party had bitten dust. All the same, it is only in Odisha where political creatures are kept under control in matters of behaviour with ordinary voters and making money on the sly by abusing authority. The Naveen Patnaik administration has made sure the politicians, irrespective of their glamour and grandeur, have to remain servants of the people.  If by any mistake, they commit an ethical or behavioural blunder, they turn things of the past instantly. The politicians of Odisha are, therefore, a highly respected lot.  ",state-editions

No end to Covid-19 in Chandigarh in sight; expert advice caution,"  The sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh has set alarm bells ringing, not just because of UT Administration’s mismanagement to contain the spread of infection but also, due to the significant gaps in the city’s existing capacity to accommodate a potential surge in the caseload. With some studies pointing out that the Covid-19 cases will peak by October end, the medical experts warn that the crisis could get worse in the union territory. Chandigarh, which is a joint capital of Punjab and Haryana, has an estimated population of 12 lakh. The contingency plan for the management of COVID-19 crisis prepared by the UT Administration had estimated that about 1 percent population of Chandigarh may be tested as positive even in the worst case scenario for the city. Hence, a plan was prepared in case of about 12000 positive cases and for the management of about 3600 active cases of Covid-19 on the worst day of the spread. The city based health experts however foresee a scenario where the active cases would soon cross 3600-mark on a day, considering a high growth rate of infection in Chandigarh. At present, the average growth rate of new infections in Chandigarh is recorded at 4.2 percent, double than the national growth rate of 2.1 percent. As far as recoveries are concerned, Chandigarh has reported a recovery rate of 65 percent against the national average of around 78 percent. The fatality rate in the city was 1.14 percent while the active ratio of cases stood at 33.3 percent which means for every 100 confirmed cases, 33 are currently infected in the city. The Pioneer spoke to several medical experts regarding their opinion on the measures that the city needs to take to stem the spread of COVID-19 Dr Ramneek Singh Bedi, Advisor, World Medical Association and former national vice-president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) We are in the middle of deepening of COVID-19 crisis as the cases are now rising at an alarming rate in Chandigarh. There is a need to impose periodic, stringent or strategic lockdown to break the chain of infection in the community. Currently, a strategic lockdown is the most scientific practice to break the chain and save the economic downturn. India went for a stringent lockdown earlier but that has proven to be an exercise in futility. Since the incubation period of the virus is five-seven days, a complete lockdown of seven-days is required to be imposed in the city. A weekend lockdown as imposed in Punjab earlier does not make any sense or serve any purpose. Despite having tertiary care medical institutions, Chandigarh is now struggling to provide effective and efficient treatment to the patients from the city and facing shortcomings in the infrastructure. So the tricity including Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula should jointly go for a complete lockdown or impose a uniform policy to stop the spread of infection. We cannot afford to avoid taking strict measures and let the infection spread further in the name of saving the economy. It is the time to take a considerate decision in striking a balance between economy and human lives, lest it will be too late in a country of 130 crore population to save either. Israel had also recently announced to re-impose the countrywide lockdown amid a stubborn surge in positive cases. Dr Yogesh Kumar Chawla, Former PGIMER Director There is no need to allow the shops to open till 9 PM when the cases are surging at a rapid pace in the city. People have become very casual and are gathering in the markets on a daily basis, violating the COVID-19 safety protocols. As a complete lockdown is not acceptable now, the timings of shops with non-essential items can be restricted to 7-7:30 pm. There was also no need to withdraw the decision of weekend closure of Sukhna Lake, which draws a huge crowd every day. Since people including the vulnerable group of senior citizens are gathering at parks and markets and are also, violating the norms of masking and social distancing, voluntary groups should be formed to report such violations and police should be more vigilant and responsive on any reports of violations. The penalty of Rs 500 for not wearing a mask should also be increased in the city. People need to understand that a vaccine is yet to be introduced for this virus and even if it is introduced, we are not sure for how long it would work as this is a mutating virus. We should never forget that prevention is better than cure. Dr Neeraj Nagpal, Convenor, Medicos Legal Action Group, Chandigarh Declaring a few houses as a micro-containment zone will not help to contain the infection. Things are beyond our control and we should now focus on facilitating the infected people who need hospitalization. People have been complaining about not getting a bed in government hospitals here. The UT Administration should put up the current status of beds in government facilities for COVID patients on its website and come out with a mechanism to ensure that at least those who need hospitalization get a bed in a government hospital without any hassle. Also, as the hospitals are now brimming with positive patients, we need to rope in hotels to increase the bed capacity in Chandigarh. The local Administration should also address the issue of black-marketing of Remdesivir, which is being sold for multiple times its retail price now. Prices of masks and gloves have also increased. People are making crores by indulging in black marketing amid the pandemic. Dr AK Mandal, Director, Intensive Care and Critical Care, Pulmonology, Fortis Hospital, Mohali We do not know how long the battle with COVID-19 would continue. In such a scenario, what people need to understand is that their actions have consequences not only for them but for their family members also. I understand there is a sense of fear and stigma surrounding COVID-19 but if someone is symptomatic, he or she should go for testing. As most of the medical institutions have reached their capacity in the city, there is also a need to develop an effective mechanism for home isolation of positive patients. Everyone does not need hospitalization for COVID-19. A coordinated policy for hospitals should be put in place for keeping a check on all patients in home isolation. A dedicated team from hospitals should also reach out to them over a call on a daily basis.  Apart from this, as senior citizens and those with co-morbidities have emerged as a vulnerable group in the COVID-19 pandemic, the authorities should efficiently monitor them to reduce the COVID fatality rate. We should understand that the cornerstone of a pandemic response is finding those infected, conducting tests, isolating the infected people and taking care of every case besides following the safety protocols. Dr Rajesh Dhir, Government Multi Speciality Hospital Sector 16 and former IMA president, Chandigarh First and foremost, people have to make changes in personal behavior. We expect the government to do everything for us but socially irresponsible behavior by educated people will cost us dear and would also take a heavy toll on our community. An ICMR study has found that a COVID-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if preventive measures such as masking, social distancing are not implemented.  The United States (US) is an example of how ignoring safety protocols can lead to serious consequences. We have to follow the simple rules of ‘washing hands, wearing a mask and maintain social distancing.’ The violators should be dealt with strictly and intensive challaning drives by police and local Administration should be conducted across the city to ensure that the safety measures are followed by the residents.

OMBADC funds spent in violation of SC norms,"  There is a strong resentment among the people of Keonjhar after the spread of the news that overlooking the guidelines of the Supreme Court, the State Government has taken a loan from the Odisha Mineral Bearing Areas Development Corporation (OMBADC)  for which only Rs 94 crore out Rs 18,000 crore is left with it. The OMBADC which is said to be a gift of the Supreme Court to the mining affected people, which was created on  December 31, 2014 by the State Government with the objective of local development and tribal welfare for ensuing inclusive growth and environmental upgradation of the mineral bearing districts of Odisha. Accordingly after the corporation was constituted, it was natural for the people of Keonjhar to hope that there would be improved infrastructure in the district facilitating livelihood enhancement, boosting human development index and reduction of income disparity. Moreover, the Supreme Court appointed Justice Anang Kumar Patnaik as the Oversight Authority to  see whether the robust fund of the OMBADC is being property utilitized or not.Former Wing Commander Engineer Kiran Sahu  who is also the president of Keonjhar Civil Society Forum said that  the people of Keonjhar district which had contributed the largest amount to the OMBADC had been deceived the most by the OMBADC board at the State level under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary of the State. Sahu said as per the guidelines of the SC, it is the duty of State Government to open one OMBADC cell at district level  but there is no OMBADC cell in Keonjhar although similar cell is working in neighboring Mayurbhanj district. Secondly , people of Keonjhar are leading a miserable life for non- implementation of many major vital projects. There is no railway link between Joda and Barbil and no flyovers at mining town of Barbil and Joda. Besides there is no facility for training of heavy vehicles operators, while there is traffic problem due to haphazard  construction work of NH- 520. In this regard , the forum has written many letters to the Oversight Authority on many occasions suggesting ways and means to come to the rescue of the mining affected people but they all have been unheard of. Rather Justice Patnaik fulfilled  his obligation to the State Government which has nominated his name for the post ignoring the interest of the mining affected people, told Sahu. However, PCC president Niranjan Patnaik told that the BJD and BJP have joined hands mutually to overlook the interest of the mining affected people and the Congress would raise the issues at different forums so that affected people are not deprived of their dues. Similarly, District Congress president Mohan Parida told that the Congress would take to streets over the issue and if required, file a case in the Supreme Court to give justice to the Keonjhar people.

V R Bhardwaj launches his book ‘The last Strand’,"  VR Bhardwaj recently launched his new book ‘The last Strand’. The title of the book itself is based on the philosophy that there is always hope. The book is an intriguing tale of two friends Shankar and Javed where their intense friendship navigates through the tests of the time, often winning but sometimes badly failing.  Overall, it is a mixed bag of emotions and thrill with life’s philosophies at its core. Bhardwaj shares his insight about his journey of authoring the book, “I always loved to write and was tossing around with a couple of story ideas since long. This plot where the lead protagonist has a violent past that haunts him and how he grows himself out of those hauntings in a way that it becomes inspiring, attracted me a lot. With the plot then emerged the characters of Shankar & Javed, the 2 friends with scarred pasts but a willingness to make a difference in the world.” As the world is going through a lot of changes, Bhardwaj shares about the relevance of the title as well as how it connects reel and the real world problems “The book title is not just a name but is actually based on the philosophy that there is always hope. Even in the most troublesome times, there is always a last hope that still connects you with a positive outcome. As the tagline of the book says, “Connecting the two worlds”, it essentially means that despite of all the odds stacked against you, that last strand has the capability to connect your inside world with the outside world and bring forth your unique identity in front of that confidently.While the people slowly lose their sense to distinguish between the reel and real worlds, “The Last Strand” helps them to reconnect with themselves and re-discover their lost parts.

Punjab Minister asks Arhtiyas to protest ‘draconian’ farm bills,"  Punjab Cabinet Minister Vijay Inder Singla on Sunday gave a call to the arhtiya (commission agents) community to protest the new draconian farm bills that the Central Government is trying to force down their throat. “I proudly say that I belong to the Arhtiya community that is the strongest link between the government and the farmers. Arhtiyas are the custodians of anaj mandis (grain markets) which are like places of worship in modern agrarian states. We will be forced to hit the roads if the Central Government does not withdraw these drastic legislations,” said Singla while addressing a meeting of Punjab-wide arhtiyas who had called upon him at his residence in Sangrur. Singla made an appeal to the Arhtiya community to hold a protest rally in the Parliament street apart from calling a “chakka jam” in the north India in solidarity with the farmers in their protests against the farm bills. He also appealed them to precisely follow the directions and advisory of Health Department to avert threat of COVID-19 contraction. Singla, the state’s School Education and Public Works Minister, expressed apprehensions that seven lakh people in Punjab will be rendered unemployed and jobless as the new legislations will deliver a deadly blow to the traditional Anaj Mandi system.

"Punjab Cong, Akalis enter verbal duel on farm bills","  WHY MUM ON PASSING OF FARM ORDINANCES WITH HARSIMRAT BEING PART OF UNION CABINET: RANDHAWA ASKS BADAL Punjab Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Sunday questioned former Chief Minister and Akali veteran Parkash Singh Badal as to why he kept mum when the farm ordinances were passed in the presence of his daughter-in-law Harsimrat Badal as the Union Minister before applauding her “resignation drama” as sacrifice. “Also explain when the close allies SAD and BJP would part ways because Akali Dal is still a part of BJP-led NDA which brought anti-farmer ordinances. Randhawa said that it would have been better if the SAD Patron could clarify before patting his party on the back as to which one of his statements given within a span of fortnight is to be believed. “The senior Badal, who sang peans to the ordinances 15 days before, has taken a u-turn like his son and daughter-in-law and started opposing the ordinances,” added Randhawa. JAKHAR SLAMS SAD FOR ACTING AS BJP AGENTS TO MISLEAD FARMERS Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Sunday that that SAD, which has transformed itself into “Sukhbir Akali Dal”, was now acting in the State as ‘BJP agent’ in a bid to mislead the farmers. “Their aim is to weaken the parties which have united against the genocidal policies of the Modi government,” he said. “Earlier acting as BJP agents, Akali leaders tried to mislead the farmers about ‘black laws’. They campaigned for the last three months in every forum, they also arranged a letter of the Union Agriculture Minister, supporting the ‘black laws’ describing the same in the interest of the farmers,” he said. Jakhar said that two facts prove that SAD was still not interested in safeguarding the farmers’ interests but was actually working for the fulfillment of aspirations of its leaders sitting in Delhi. “Firstly, Harsimrat resigned from the Union Ministry but said that SAD would remain a partner in the Central Government. Secondly, she still says that she herself doesn’t feel that the agriculture amendment laws were anti-farmer but farmers were terming these as anti-farmers,” he added. SAD DARES CM TO FACE FARMERS, ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS SAD on Sunday asked Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to first tell why he had supported the framing of agricultural ordinances before asking any questions from the opposition. SAD’s Kisan wing president and former Minister Sikandar Singh Maluka said that Capt Amarinder did not have any answers to the questions and that was why he was trying to shoot and scoot as always.

"Punjab Govt to take BJP, its allies to court","  Vowing to fight till his last breath to protect the interests of the State’s farmers, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday said that the State Government will take the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies, including the Akalis, to the court over the new “unconstitutional, undemocratic and anti-farmer” laws of the Central Government. “We will move the courts and fight the draconian legislations as soon as they get the presidential nod and become the law of the land,” he said, expressing shock at the way the BJP-led Union Government brute-forced the Agriculture Bills through the Rajya Sabha on Sunday. The Chief Minister questioned the rationale behind putting the controversial and vicious Bills, which were a blatant encroachment of the State’s powers and control of the Agriculture sector, to voice vote, despite strong reservations by the Opposition and inadequate numbers in the House. Why did the House not go for division of votes on this critical issue, which has even divided the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), he asked. Capt Amarinder said that his Government will not allow the Central Government, of which the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) continues shamelessly to be a part, to trample the rights and interests of the farmers through these cruel legislations designed to destroy the farmers, and Punjab state for which agriculture is its lifeline. “We stand with the farmers and will do whatever it takes to protect their interests,” he declared.  “They (BJP and its allies) clearly don’t care for what these laws will do to the farmers,” he said, flaying the BJP-led Government for selling the interests of the farmers to big corporates. BJP’s so-called ‘watershed’ moment will be the death of agriculture and will endanger the nation’s food security, warned the Chief Minister. “By pushing the Bills through without consultation with the key stakeholders and even without taking the Government of Punjab, a major contributor to India’s agricultural sector growth, into confidence, the Central Government has shown that it has no concern whatsoever for the farmers or the farm sector,” he said. Pointing out that the Bills nowhere make any mention of retaining the MSP (minimum support price), Capt Amarinder said that this clearly exposes the “ill intent” of the Central Government, which has a poor trust record as far as states go.  “If they could not adhere to the clearly defined provisions on GST, how can one trust them to uphold their verbal assurances on MSP,” he questioned. The CM asked ‘if these legislations are actually revolutionary and in the interests of farmers, why are the farmers out on the roads in protest?’ The farmers are not fools and would not be marching to Delhi, braving a pandemic, if they did not find the Bills damaging and detrimental to their interests, he said. Pointing out that these farmers were nowhere near getting the Government-mandated MSP on their foodgrains in the open market that exists even today to a limited extent, the Chief Minister said that it was unfortunate that instead of strengthening the State-led marketing system, as the Congress had promised in its manifesto, the Central Government had chosen to end it completely. He also lashed out at the Opposition for continuing to mislead the farmers by spread misinformation on the Congress manifesto of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, which spoke of repeal of existing APMC Act in order to bring a new, improved legislation that would provide for more markets and more facilities for procurement of the farmers’ produce. What is more, the Congress manifesto clearly and categorically promised to retain the MSP regime, which the BJP Government is refusing to do, he added.  ",state-editions

Adult female elephant dies of electrocution in Ranchi village,"  A 35-year-old female elephant died of electrocution in Dhelwatand village of Khalari block on Saturday morning after coming in contact with a high-tension wire placed by villagers at a farm field to generate power for watering the field, forest officials said. While villagers have pleaded innocence terming the death of the tusker as an accident, forest officials have initiated a probe into the matter to see if the wire was deliberately placed in the field to harm elephants. “The possibility of villagers deliberately placing the wire in the field to harm elephants cannot be denied. However, prima facie, it seems that the wire was placed in the field to supply power to machines used for irrigation,” said District Forest Officer (DFO), Ranchi, Ashok Kumar Dubey. According to the DFO, the naked wire was hanging at a height where it can only come in contact with an animal as tall as an elephant. “This indicates that the wire was not placed there to keep other wild animals at bay,” said Dubey, assuring that the villagers responsible for the incident will be prosecuted. Forest officials recently chased away a herd of elephants from Dhelwatand village, and the female elephant who died on Saturday is assumed to be a member of the same herd. The elephant came in contact with the naked wire, hanging from a pole, while she was crossing the farm field, forest officials said. As per records with the forest department, at least three elephants died of electrocution in Ranchi last year.  The forest department, however, does not have any data on the total number of elephants that have died of electrocution across Jharkhand. On an average eight elephants were killed annually in past one decade in Jharkhand. As per the elephant mortality data with the state forest department, a total of 82 elephants were killed from 2009-10 to 2018-19. The man-elephant conflict in Jharkhand has been a concern for wildlife conservationists in the state. Since tuskers often go on rampage in villages and even cause human fatalities, villagers in many areas of the state take measures at their own level to tackle with jumbo menace, sources said. Under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, people involved in harming an elephant or even attempting to harm an elephant can be imprisoned for up to seven years.  ",state-editions

Agitation threat by students of Sikkim college," The students of Government Vocational College  at Dentam in West Sikkim have threatened to take the agitation path from September 12 if their long-pending demands, including introduction of post-graduate courses and permanent campus, are not met by the state government.
The college, which was set up in 2017 with under-graduate courses in tourism, software development and retail management, operates from a rented building and has a student-strength of 160. The first batch of 60-odd students would have graduated in June, but the final exams had to be postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Apart from starting PG courses and permanent campus, the other demands of the students are providing facilities like on-the job training, field trips, internships, workshops and industrial visits with financial support and provisions like laboratory, library, Internet and buses.
“From September 12, 2020, we the students of GVC Dentam are going to start a series of activities to press for the immediate fulfillment of our demands. This will go until all our demands are fulfilled unconditionally,” said the students in a release issued in Gangtok on Tuesday.
The students regretted that despite several petitions to both the previous and present governments, nothing had been done to address their issues. “Despite receiving verbal assurances from chief minister downwards, there has been no progress on the ground. The students have been rendered helpless as a result of the total negligence on the part of the concerned department and the government,” the students alleged.
Punyaprasad Sharma, the principal of GVC Dentam, said the permanent campus spread over seven acres was coming up, but admitted to the delay in construction because of various factors, including disruptions caused by the pandemic.
“The construction was started in 2019. Plinth level work is going on,” he said, adding the Union ministry of human resource development had sanctioned Rs 26 crore for the project.
Sharma said since the new campus would take time to be completed, a proposal was mooted to shift the college to a bigger building owned by the government at Dentam. “But the proposal has been stalled because of the pandemic.”",states

Covid protocol breach case on duo in Sikkim," Sikkim police on Monday filed a case against two visiting technicians who tested positive for Covid-19 for allegedly violating the Covid-19 protocol and endangering the lives of others.
The duo were part of a five-member team from Calcutta and Delhi and visited Gangtok on August 6 for maintenance work at State Data Centre at the IT department’s invitation.
IT secretary Mrinalini Shrivastava sought special permission from the East Sikkim administration for the team’s entry. Granting permission, the district administration had stated that the team would have to undergo rapid antigen test at the entry point, and travel to their places of work and stay in an ambulance under police cover at all times.
During their week-plus stay, the team visited other places and met some MLAs, including Aditya Golay, son of chief minister P.S. Tamang (Golay), and bureaucrats at meetings facilitated by the IT department. Two team members tested positive on Sunday.
The police filed a case against the two under IPC sections for disobedience of public order and endangering lives of others, and for refusing to comply with the government directive under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
S. C. Gupta, the state’s chief secretary, sought an explanation from IT secretary Shrivastava on the issue.
Since some meetings took place at the Tashiling secretariat in Gangtok, the entire complex has been declared as a containment zone.
The incident created a furore in Sikkim with many wondering why the administration had not acted with same alacrity against politicians and bureaucrats as they did against the technician duo.",states
Don’t derail HIV combat: Forum," The Sikkim Drug Users’ Forum (SDUF) has expressed fears that HIV prevention activities may have taken a back seat in Sikkim because of an allegedly lax state health department amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Forum president Rinzing Bhutia said HIV prevention programme should not be derailed despite the prevailing Covid pandemic.
“An emerging public health crisis should not be the reason to derail the handling of an existing crisis,” she said.
Citing an example of the department’s alleged casual attitude, Bhutia said a counsellor attached to the oral substitute therapy (OST) centre at Jorethang Hospital and a technician at the integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) at Namchi District Hospital were transferred over a year back, but their replacements had not yet arrived.
Even more perplexing is the fact that the two persons who had been transferred worked for the State AIDS Control Society under the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) of the Union health ministry, she said.
Bhutia added that the two persons who were transferred had been trained and experienced persons. Such transfers affect the continuity of effective HIV service deliveries, she said.
“Ideally, we would want the department to retransfer both to their original places of posting instead of giving replacements,” she added.
The SDUF president also said her organisation had written to Sikkim health minister M.K. Sharma on July 6 on the issue, but got no response.
“If there is no positive action on the issue, the health minister will be held accountable for any loss of life and the spread of new HIV infections in the state,” she warned.
Sources said Sikkim now has a little over 200 patients under antiretroviral therapy, or the HIV treatment regime.
The Telegraph could not contact the health minister on phone despite repeated attempts.
The Sikkim Drug Users’ Forum initiates community-led action for the health and rights of the people who use drugs.
The SDUF has said that during the Covid-induced lockdown in Sikkim, it has been “tirelessly delivering crucial life-saving medicines to people suffering from HIV”, among others.",states
Sikkim public figure CD Rai passes away," Sikkim politician, bureaucrat and journalist C.D. Rai died at the age of 96 at his Gangtok residence on Saturday night.
His mortal remains were cremated at the Jalipool Crematorium in East Sikkim on Sunday.
Rai served in different departments of the government of Sikkim during his time as a bureaucrat. Rai had also been a minister in the short-lived government of Tashi Thsering in 1949 when Sikkim was an independent kingdom.
In between and post-retirement, he engaged in journalism and was the Sikkim correspondent of the Calcutta-based Amrita Bazar Patrika in the early 1960s. He was also the editor of Himali Bela, a Nepali daily, and publisher of Gangtok Times.
Rai leaves behind a son, a daughter and grandchildren. His son, P. D. Rai, is a two-term parliamentarian and a senior leader of the Sikkim Democratic Front.
Chief minister P. S. Tamang (Golay) said in Rai’s passing away, Sikkim had lost one of its most famous and reputed sons. “The contribution made by him for Sikkim and the
people is unparalleled and his demise has created a dent in the intellectual society of Sikkim,” he added.
Governor Ganga Prasad said Rai had worn many hats with distinction during his long innings in public life. “He will be remembered for his immense contribution, and let the contribution made by Shri C. D Rai be (a) source of inspiration for new generations,” he said.
Former chief minister and SDF president Pawan Chamling, too, mourned the death of Rai.
 “Shri C.D. Rai’s death is a tremendous loss for Sikkim and he will be forever remembered for his contributions and service to our state. I express my heartfelt condolences to his family,” he said.",states
Sikkim rail link by 2022-end," Sikkim will be part of India’s rail map by 2022-end, Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) officials said, speaking about the long-delayed project whose foundation was laid in 2009 when Mamata Banerjee was the railways minister.
“With the sanction of new line work from Sevoke (Bengal) up to Rangpo (Sikkim), it is expected that Sikkim would be linked by December 2022. The Centre is putting stress to execute the project fast,” said S. Chanda, NFR’s chief PRO. 
From Sevoke, it will be a 45km route to Rangpo, tracks will cover 13 bridges and 14 tunnels, with stations in Rangpo, Ryang, Teestabazar and Melli. 
The plan to make tunnels and set up tracks in five years did not happen because of forestland acquisition, quakes and landslides, said sources. 
An official said that over the past few months, work suffered again because of labour shortage amid Covid-19. 
The need for rail connectivity to Sikkim on the Indo-Sino border has been pointed out time and again by defence analysts, particularly after the Dokalam stand-off and the recent confrontation in Ladakh.
Even today, NH10 is the only road that connects the state with rest of the country.
The project costs Rs 1,339 crore. In the current fiscal, Rs 607 crore has been sanctioned.",states
Varsity offer for soldier’s sister," Visva-Bharati varsity officials, led by vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty, on Sunday went to Birbhum’s Belgoria to meet the family of soldier Rajesh Orang, who was killed in the Galwan Valley clash, and handed his sister Shakuntala a letter from the registrar saying she was welcome to pursue her higher education at the varsity.
Shakuntala, a second-year undergraduate student at a college in Jharkhand, said she was “humbled” and would like to pursue her master’s degree at Visva-Bharati.
Chakrabarty expressed pride at Birbhum “having given birth to a son like Rajesh”.
The varsity also gave Rs 2.5 lakh to the Orang family, the VC added.
Visva-Bharati officials said they would look into including Belgoria village in its rural extension centre programme to enhance schools and training centres.
“Rabindranath Tagore had laid down our ethos as being one where we take care of our neighbours, and neighbouring villages,” the VC said.",states
"Stand-up, Aussie style"," A bunch of 10-year-old boys came up to Aussie Daniel Connell and asked him to play a game of cricket with them.
“Yes, I’d play. ‘Are you a fast bowler’, they asked me. And I said yes. ‘Nah, we don’t want to play with you’, they said and left,” Connell said.
Brace for more such self-deprecating Aussie humour as the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Roadshow India 2018 plays out on Sunday at Club Boudoir with some of the festival’s topline comedians, including Daniel Connell, Guy Montgomery, Aaron Chen and Mel Buttle.
The Melbourne International Comedy Festival started in 1987 around April Fools’ Day and has grown bigger since. It’s a month-long comedy festival with some of the big names in Aussie humour, including political satirist Sammy J, Josh Thomas and Dave Hughes. It started out with stand-up and cabaret acts, but today it has sketch shows (lines are acted out), plays, improvised theatre, and musical shows.
The MICF has been travelling to India and this is their fourth visit, Gideon James, associate director of MICF, said.
“A part of the Australian character is that they don’t take themselves too seriously and are able to laugh at themselves very much. And Australians love to have a good laugh at their politicians and the politicians know that too,” Connell, who can be described as “the ideal Aussie comedian”, affable, loveable and hilarious, said.
The Australian cricket team will get it high and dry on Sunday as Connell takes the stage (“Oh, they’ve been performing miserably”), though one can’t say Virat Kohli can breathe easy even with a knockout performance.
“It’s hard to take Kohli out, he does everything right,” Connell said. A traditional stand-up comedian who finds his jokes in his family and day-to-day life, Connell has picked up some local stuff on Diwali and Calcutta streets to add a local flavour to his 20-minute act.
Apart from Connell, there will be New Zealander Guy Montgomery, an award-winning comedian, improviser and screenwriter, Aaron Chen, a Sydney boy with an exquisite mic technique and Mel Buttle, a weekly columnist who is a co-host on The Great Australian Bake Off.
The only female comedian in the team, Mel, said she used to teach drama to high-school students when she went for a stand-up comedy workshop. “I liked it and got hooked on to it and tried to get better every day.”",states
Santanan dehi: Gender-neutral mantra a hit from Calcutta to London," Close to 500,000 people have registered their support for the call to change a mantra that seeks only a son from the Mother Goddess. In response to a campaign launched by The Telegraph, they have pledged to chant santanan dehi, wanting a child irrespective of gender, in place of putran dehi, which discriminates against daughters.
“Ma-er pujo korbo ar chaibo sudhu chhele? (We’d worship the Mother Goddess but seek only son)?” said Sandipan Banerjee, puja committee convener of Behala Nutan Dal. The club has already spoken to its priest who conducts the anjali. “There is no harm if the mantra is changed,” said Bappaditya Mukherjee, who has been conducting the puja for 19 years according to the Devipuran.
“The mantra dates back to an age when people wanted sons rather than daughters. But we are not in that age any more,” said Parimal Dey, president of Beliaghata 33 No. Palli Bashi Brinda.
Two of London’s pujas, too, have embraced the change. If London Sharad Utsav, housed in Ealing Town Hall, is putting up posters of the campaign, Camden Durga Puja is showing the campaign’s short films, created by The Telegraph and featuring Bengali actors and actresses, on the giant screen at the venue.
“We learnt about the campaign quite late but took no time to come on board. The initiative to seek a child irrespective of gender from the goddess finds synergy with our theme of Tomar Durga, Amar Durga, which encompasses not only the affluent daughters but also the impoverished ones who jump into the river post-immersion to salvage coins or bamboo structures or seek food in dustbins. We are welcoming the LGBTQ community to our puja,” said Ananda Gupta, the chairperson of the 56-year-old Camden puja.

Barriers control Calcutta Metro crowd," Metro is trying to restrict overcrowding on and off platforms at some stations during Durga Puja.
The plan is being implemented at Kalighat, along with a few other stations, said a Metro official.
Metro personnel, who have been engaged to manage crowds at the stations, are deploying steel barriers to temporarily stop people from entering the platforms once they are getting overcrowded.
Once a train leaves the platform and the place becomes less crowded, passengers are being let in, the official said. As the area in front of ticket counters has limited capacity, entry to the station is being stopped temporarily to avoid overcrowding.
“When access to the platform is closed and the crowd is swelling in front of the ticket counters, Calcutta police personnel deployed at entry points to the stations are stopping passengers temporarily,” said a Metro official.

Separate entry and exit gates have been designated to control the crowd.
At the ticket counters, too, the Metro authorities have made provisions for multiple small queues.
“On Panchami, October 3, Metro ferried 9.28 lakh passengers, which officials said was the highest ever. To manage the huge crowd, we have introduced the new plans. The idea is to prevent stampede-like situation,” said Indrani Banerjee, chief public relations officer, Metro Railway.
Some of the other plans include not to allow two trains in opposite directions to stop at a station at the same time.
Also, when the number of passengers exiting the platform is becoming too high, Metro personnel are collecting tokens from passengers and depositing those in buckets. This is being done to ensure faster exit of passengers.",states
Odisha acts to end electrocution of elephants," After the electrocution of seven elephants in Dhenkanal district, forest authorities in the district have asked the energy department to be careful about the power supply infrastructure in the elephant habitat areas.
A 1.8km stretch of the forest area has been identified as a vulnerable corridor of elephants in Kenonjhar forest division as high-voltage electric wires are sagging at a low height at specific spots. The North Eastern Electricity Supply Company of Odisha Limited (Nesco) authorities have been strictly told to ensure that the electric wires were placed at a height of 17-18ft above the ground.
The forest department is deeply concerned over the incident that took place in Sadar forest range of Dhenkanal district. The Nesco has been directed to take corrective measures on a war-footing so that elephants are protected from sagging overhead lines, said an official of Keonjhar forest division.
The forest department has also asked the Nesco to undertake the underground cable work of high-tension supply lines across vulnerable zones to protect elephants from electrocution.
According to latest census of these animals, Keonjhar is home to 40 elephants. Elephants frequently migrate from Jharkhand to Keonjhar forest. About 149 elephants are firmly ensconced in the forest. The animals are straying into the forested areas of Keonjhar from Similpal Tiger Reserve in Mayurbhanj district and Jharkhand.

The vulnerable zones where electric lines were found sagging are located in Champua, Bhuian Juanga Peedha forest range, Sadar and Barbil forest ranges.
Elephants perishing due to electrocution have been a few over the years. According to the last record, two full-grown elephants died in 2011 when came in contact with sagging live wire in Telekoi of Keonjhar district.
The forest department has also issued advisories asking the railway authorities to initiate corrective measures for protection of elephants from getting killed on railway tracks. The officials of Keonjhar forest division and East Coast Railway authorities held discussions on Thursday to ensure the safety of these animals, who face the threat of being mowed by moving trains.
The Daitary-Banshapala rail line stretches across 42km through the forest areas of the Keonjhar district. These areas are elephant habitation corridors. It is also the migration path of these animals. So, safety of these animals has been prioritised in co-ordination with the railways. The railway authorities have consented to impose suitable speed restrictions on identified locations.
Signage boards have been installed on identified corridors. The elephant squad staffs, who track the animals’ movement along the rail line zones, will swiftly inform the forest department control room, which in return would alert the rail control room for speed control of moving passenger and goods trains. The railways have been asked to reduce the train speed to 30km per hour on the elephant migration rail route, an official said.",states
Odisha’s Bali yatra kiosks get cop permits," Police have started issuing licence for operation of shopping kiosks and pavilions at Bali yatra this year.
A licence from the deputy commissioner of police is mandatory to operate a kiosk at the Bali yatra that will start on November 23 this year.
For centuries, Bali yatra has been a week-long fair at Killa Maidan near Gadgadia Shiv Temple on the banks of Mahanadi river from the day of the auspicious Kartik Purnima.
The government had extended the annual fair to Talapadia (area on the riverbed) in 1996.
More than a thousand pavilions and kiosks (mostly eateries) are expected to come up at the site this year. More than 40 acres at Killamaidan in front of the Barabati fort gate and on the riverbed will be distributed among parties interested to set up kiosks.
Assistant commissioner of police Asim Mishra said a counter for issuing licence started functioning at the Bali yatra ground from Thursday.
“For getting a licence, the shopkeepers or those opening pavilions and kiosks will have to produce a no-objection certificate related to land allotment (which will be tallied with the records of the local tehsil office), document related to temporary power connection from the Central Electricity Supply Utility, a fire safety certificate and clearance from Cantonment police station along with a licence fee of Rs 100,” Mishra said.
“For using sound system, shopkeepers will have to submit evidence of use of sound system with pre-installed sound limiters for 65 decibel and pay Rs 200 per day. The shopkeepers will also have to submit an indemnity bond executed on Rs 100 in non-judicial stamp paper,” he said.

The police also want to make it mandatory for auction holders of parking stands to display the rate chart of various types of vehicles prominently in Odia and English.",states
Mall fire papers under scan in Calcutta," The fire department will send a notice to the developers and the management of AMP Vaisaakkhi mall asking them to furnish fire-safety papers, a senior officer said on Friday, a day after a blaze in the basement of the building in Salt Lake’s AG block.
According to the officer, the mall management has been asked to come to the fire department’s headquarters on Free School Street in Calcutta with the latest copies of the fire licence and fire audits.
The fire on Thursday afternoon left at least three cars completely burnt and more than 10 two-wheelers charred. The blaze broke out at a time hundreds of shoppers as well as employees of several offices were inside the mall. On Friday, the mall was closed as electricity supply was yet to be restored, an official said.
The director-general of fire services, Jag Mohan, said on Friday that a forensic survey would be carried out at the two levels of the building where the fire had broken out.
“A forensic team accompanied by fire scene investigators will go to the building and collect samples. This will help us find out how the fire started and whether or not the hydrants had worked,” said Mohan.
There are several fire hydrants in the mall but there was no supply of water because the reservoir was empty, some local residents who took part in the rescue operation had alleged on Thursday. Before the fire brigades came to the spot, they had tried to control the blaze by activating the hydrants.
According to Mohan, preliminary investigations had revealed that the fire had possibly started from sparks arising out of a welder’s torch. The blaze was first spotted around 3.10pm and brought under control around 8.30pm. More than 15 fire tenders battled the flames.",states
Gautam Deb asks schools not to hike fees," Bengal tourism minister Gautam Deb held a meeting with representatives of 55 private English medium schools located in and around Siliguri on Tuesday and elaborated on the orders issued by the state education department with regard to the fees charged by these institutions.
The meeting was held as guardians of the city had been making posts in social media for the past few weeks, mentioning that some schools were charging higher fees while others were not waiving even a portion of the transport charges for the lockdown period.
“All schools have been requested not to increase their fees for the 2020-21 academic year. We have found that some schools had increased their fees but after the state government came up with a notice, they revoked their decision and will charge old fees,” Deb said after the meeting.
The schools, he said, should also consider the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown had left a negative impact on the economy.
“In the current situation, some guardians might not be able to pay school fees on time. We want the schools to provide time to such guardians to pay the fees. Those present at the meeting have said they will consider this issue,” the minister said.
Deb said the state had not taken any decision on transport charges. The guardians have pointed out that as buses are off the roads, the schools should waive the fuel and maintenance charges.
“I will talk to the state education minister on this issue and we will see that it is also resolved,” he said.
A section of schools, which are members of the West Bengal Unaided CBSE Schools’ Association, had already taken decisions on certain issues, said its secretary Vijay Shah.
“We have decided not to revise the fees for the academic year and lower the bus fees up to 33 per cent for the first quarter. Our member schools have been asked to take a lenient and soft stand towards allowing reasonable time to pay school fees,” Shah said.",states
Coronavirus leaves void at Chowrasta," The novel coronavirus has changed Chowrasta.
The most famous square in Darjeeling wore a new look on Tuesday morning after the administration decided to remove all benches.
Chowrasta without benches was unthinkable even a few months ago though politicians had on and off disturbed the unique ambience of the promenade by erecting ugly structures much to the chagrin of local people.
However, the unthinkable became a reality on Tuesday morning and none is complaining.
“This is a temporary measure. The administration informed us that people would crowd (by sitting on the benches) the Mall right from the morning and at times, violate social distancing norms. It was difficult to man the place all through the day,” said C.P. Subba, secretary, Darjeeling municipality.

Around 30 concrete and wooden benches were removed from Chowrasta on Monday evening.
It would be hard to find any traveller to Darjeeling who has not sat on these benches to enjoy the sights and sounds of this hill town.
For the locals, sitting on the benches is part of life’s routine.
The sentiment attached to the benches was captured in a Nepali song “Chowrasta ko benchi haru (Benches of Chowrasta)” which was written and composed by Prasanna Singh and sung by Sanjay Mangrati some years ago.
“It might have been a first but it was the need of the hour as social gathering has to be discouraged at all cost,” said a morning walker who did not wish to be named.
In another first, Sangay Tshering and another hotelier here have offered rooms for free to the Darjeeling district administration to house inbound travellers until their swab reports arrive.
“This is my contribution to Darjeeling. We as a family decided to let out the hotel so that people, some of whom are coming following medical treatment, can have a comfortable stay,” said Tshering who is also the president of the Darjeeling Hotel Owners’ Association.
Tshering, however, said he had taken the decision in his individual capacity.

Data show tea loss up to 46% in Bengal," Tea gardens in north Bengal suffered crop losses to the extent of 46 per cent till the end of April this year because of the lockdown, show a set of figures published by the Tea Research Association at Jorhat in Assam.
According to sources at the TRA, they obtained data from 459 tea gardens in Assam, Bengal and Tripura to assess the losses caused by the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Assam and Bengal contribute to the maximum portion of the tea produced in India.
“The data of crop loss in March and April — virtually the first two months of the current production season when plucking resumed in tea gardens from the third week of February according to the directive of the Tea Board of India — were collated. It has been found that tea gardens in the Terai and the Dooars have lost close to half of their crop vis-à-vis 2019. In the Darjeeling hills, the loss of crop is comparatively less, that is, slightly above 30 per cent,” said a source.
While the Terai tea belt suffered a production loss of 46 per cent, it was 46.2 per cent in the Dooars. In the hills, the cross loss was 31.1 per cent.
The information available with the TRA shows that the loss varies from 46.5 per cent to 72.8 per cent in different brew belts of Assam — the largest producer of tea in the country.
Tripura suffered a crop loss of 63.6 per cent from March till April 30.
In the three states, there were huge differences in the quantity of tealeaves plucked in March and April compared to 2019.
In Bengal, the total amount of plucked tealeaves in March and April last year was around 125. 51 lakh kg. But the figure came down to 69.86 lakh kg in the corresponding months this year.
The margin is much higher in Assam and Tripura, show the data with the TRA.
Tea planters said the actual loss could be higher than the estimates made by the TRA. “The actual crop loss might go up as reports from the ground indicate a sharp drop in the production because of cumulative disruptions brought about by the lockdown. First, there was a complete shutdown, followed by permission for skiffing. Then, production resumed in the tea plantations with truncated workforce. These days, variations in the temperature stunted the growth of tea leaves,” said Prabir Bhattacharjee, secretary general, Tea Association of India.",states

Shops in ease-up belts of Calcutta don’t need pass or nod," Shops that are not in malls and not in Covid-19-hit zones can start operating from May 21, maintaining distancing rules and hygiene, police said on Tuesday.
Malls will remain closed, though, the police said.
The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the city police will prepare a list of places that are in the affected, buffer and clean zones within a Red Zone and an Orange Zone. The government has decided to subdivide the two zones to ease restrictions in places within the zones that have not been hit by the coronavirus, a civic official said.
“No passes or permission will be needed to open shops outside affected zones. They will have to follow the basic rules of distancing and the restrictions on the number of customers, apart from the directives on staff strength mentioned in the government order,” Subhankar Sinha Sarkar, joint commissioner (headquarters), said.
Affected zones are places that have reported Covid-19 patients. A buffer zone is immediately outside an affected zone and a clean zone is a place, which has not reported any Covid-19 patients.
Once a list of affected, buffer and clean zones has been created, it will be uploaded on the CMC’s website, a civic official said.
Government guidelines have said shop owners will have to ensure not more than five people can enter a shop at a time and that they maintain a distance of at least 6ft among themselves.
There was confusion among some traders if they could open shops after checking the list or if some permission was needed.
“We need an official intimation from the CMC, allowing us to open the market…. After we receive official communication, we will approach the police and try to clarify other points… such as if we have to follow the odd/even rule for opening shops,” Asraf Ali, joint secretary of the SS Hogg Market Traders association, said.
A few standalone shops in the Jadavpur-Baghajatin area have started operations but there is no instruction if all shops can open simultaneously, an officer of Jadavpur police station said.
There is no specific embargo on opening shops outside affected zones, an officer in Lalbazar said.
It is mandatory for shop owners to use masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. Shops can operate with a staff strength of either 50 per cent or 25 per cent depending on their locations, according to the government guidelines.",states

“We have to depute nurses and technicians besides installing the machines and equipment. This is a time-consuming process. I am hoping that the department will become operational in 15-20 days. Once it happens, we will be able to offer three-day OPD (outpatient department) services besides dialysis and other facilities. Transplants will start later,” Dr Pant said.

A RIMS insider said Dr Pant’s salary would be much lower than what she used to get at the private hospital.
On what motivated her to join RIMS on a lower pay, Pant said: “Job satisfaction and opportunity to use knowledge for the poor in a better way.”
Pant, a doctor of medicine in nephrology from Banaras Hindu University, has always been proactive in serving the poor since her arrival to Ranchi in 2015 with her husband Dr Jayant Kumar Ghosh, 40, a doctor of medicine in gastroenterology from the same institute.
Pant, who did her schooling from Hardiwar, had set up a clinic on the ground floor of a three-storey building near her husband’s ancestral home on Line Tank Road for the poor.
Former Assembly Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari had inaugurated the clinic, which was spread over 3,000 square feet.
Even during her stint at the private hospital, Pant was known for her spirit of service.",states
Vaccination hit as clinics around the city still closed," Immunisation and check-ups remain a worry because many doctors, including those who have started returning to outpatient departments of private hospitals, are yet to see patients in their standalone clinics, doctors and hospital officials said.
Most standalone clinics are located in houses of doctors, many of who seem to think adequate safety measures against Covid-19 could not be taken at the clinics.
Immunisation of children, which has been hit hard by the Covid-related lockdown, remains a worry for many parents in Calcutta.
“We don’t want to take our child to hospital now because no one knows whether there is an asymptomatic coronavirus carrier. The risk is very much there despite the safety measures taken by the various hospital managements. The paediatrician of our child is insisting that we go to the hospital OPD because his private clinic is still closed,” said a 30-year-old mother, a resident of south Calcutta.
A paediatrician who has opened his private clinic said he was getting calls for appointments from parents who usually go to other doctors.
“In all the cases, the parents want to get their children vaccinated,” he said.
The doctor said that to ensure social distancing he was asking some of the parents to go to private hospitals.
“But they are reluctant to go to any hospital,” said the doctor.
According to paediatricians, some of the essential vaccines are administered to newborns before they are discharged from hospital.
“During a pandemic like Covid-19, vaccines for influenza, measles and pneumonia should ideally be administered. Also, there are some other vaccines like triple antigen and polio that should not wait. However, some other vaccines can be administered some time after the due date,” said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health.
He said the immunisation programme had been affected because of the lockdown and the fear of contracting the novel coronavirus.
Not only immunisation, consultations and routine check-ups, too, are yet to return to normal as many doctors have not reopened their clinics.
One such doctor, a ENT specialist, said he had started doing procedures at a private hospital from Monday but was not seeing patients at his two clinics in south Calcutta.
Doctors who have resumed seeing patients at OPDs are scared of opening their private clinics. The doctors feel hospitals can provide more protection against Covid-19 than small standalone clinics.
The chief executive officer of a private hospital said they were providing several layers of safety for doctors.
While booking an appointment online, a patient is paying the fee so there is no queue at the cash counter. At most private hospitals, patients are undergoing thermal screening for body temperature and another test for oxygen saturation level in the blood, which is an indicator of the functioning of the lungs.
“The OPD clinic is sanitised after every consultation. Those patients who are coming without a mask are being provided one,” the CEO said.
He said it would be difficult to make all these arrangements at a standalone clinic.
To take such measures, doctors will have to hire more people.
“But the number of patients are still less because many are preferring video consultations over going to the clinic. So, the maximum effort and investment to ensure safety can bring only minimum revenue in standalone clinics. Viability is what doctors are looking at,” said an official of another private hospital.",states
The names of our countries didn’t matter," Not always, but at times you are hurt, and what hurts you is not called anything, because what is being done to you remains invisible. In another place it would be called old-world racism, but in Calcutta that word is not used much, as if it happens in Minneapolis, not here.
One wonders how it affects a bright young person who comes to the city with a dream.
Felicity Dindiwe was 20 when she came to Calcutta seven years ago from Lusaka, the Zambian capital, on a scholarship to study economics at Jadavpur University. She is an attractive young woman — she got a few modelling assignments in the city — and very precise. She seems to remember everything about her stay here with great clarity, including dates. “I came on July 8, 2013, and left on September 28, 2018,” says Felicity, now 27, speaking from Lusaka. She is now helping her father to manage his mining company, which deals in coal and amethysts, and is very busy.
Zambia is not in lockdown because of Covid and the situation is not very bad.
Did her five years in the city include bad experiences because of the colour of her skin?
Not always, but sometimes, yes, she says. She does not speak with rancour. It is not easy to categorise experience in any case. But her very first interaction with the city was a shock. “The taxi driver charged Rs 1,000 from the airport to Jadavpur,” she says.
“It’s not fair, is it, just because we are foreigners?” But that was discrimination at its mildest, cheating actually, and the city tends to fleece all foreigners equally, Black or White, even if it treats them differently. She would face other things.
Felicity did not want to stay at the university hostel at first. Thus began the house-hunt. “It was hectic.” She was on a scholarship, on a shoe-string budget, and struggling under the pressure of her economics honours course. “I had a lot to catch up with,” she says. She had chosen to study here as she felt that Indian education had a higher standard than the Zambian.
Landlords did not turn her down because she was African, she feels, “though others I knew were”. In the five years she lived in four south Calcutta apartments.
At one of the flats she rented, the landlady did not mind her. But there would be trouble if her African friends, girls who were studying engineering in Durgapur, came over for the weekend. “Then she would demand that they pay extra for the water and the electricity,” says Felicity. The landlady would feel that somehow the flat would suffer with the girls around. “But we were neat people. We weren’t messy!” says Felicity.
It was as if a question always hung in the air about their moral character, irrespective of their behaviour, as it often does for people from the North-East. As long as Felicity brought no one in, it was fine. The moment that happened, it disturbed the equilibrium. “The landlady was trying to treat us like children.” Other African students, men from Tanzania and Namibia, who had rented flats in the same house, left.
“In fact we are never asked which country in Africa we are from,” says Felicity.
At the end of her first three years, she decided to move into the university hostel after all. Where food was a bit of a problem, as her palate was not used to the spices of Bengali cooking. But that would not change. Felicity managed. She basically stayed in her room. “There was also the language barrier.”
She remembers with gratitude the effort some of her teachers at the economics department made to help her with her studies. She is also in touch with her former classmates.
Local markets could be terrible. “At the vegetable and meat shops, some would refuse to sell us their stuff,” says Felicity. And festive days could be humiliating: they could feel like true outsiders.
“During the Durga Puja, my friends and I did not want to come back early in the evenings, as there was always a deadline. So we wanted to book a hotel for the night,” says Felicity. Most hotels told them that they would not accept Africans as guests, just as they do not accept couples who are not married.
“But we were treated well in restaurants. And we used to often go to South City mall for its AC,” says Felicity. She got spotted at the mall for modelling. She featured in the ad campaigns of a few brands, including Super Dry (in picture). She also got film offers.
The glamour world did not make her feel unwelcome at all. She attended events and went to parties, and enjoyed herself. The film roles she was offered did not make her feel uncomfortable in any way. Ironically, here she was not made to feel excessively sexual, which is another stereotype of the African woman.
She felt more unsafe in the Metro. “My friend and I were in the Metro. A man touched her bottom. There were so many other women. Why did the man have to choose her?” she asks.
But she speaks calmly, and never mentions the R-word herself in the context of Calcutta. About George Floyd’s death, though, she says that it was even more tragic because he belonged to the country, the US.
And on the whole, India was amazing, she says. She would have even liked to stay on and work in Delhi. But she did not get a job that she had wanted.
She wants to be an entrepreneur as well as hold a corporate job. And now she has to run, because there’s too much work!",states
Amphan’s Swords of Damocles," Half-broken street lights, inclined trees and collapsed billboards — tell-tale signs of the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan — still lean on the city and the monsoon is likely to compound the threat they pose to commuters and others.
The Telegraph spotted many such hazards across Calcutta.
An overturned billboard has blocked the footpath in front of Apeejay House on Park Street. The sharp, rusted edges of the twisted frame protrude outside towards the road.
Pedestrians are forced to walk down the carriageway to avoid getting hurt while trying to squeeze through small gaps on the footpath on that stretch. Broken and tattered billboards were spotted in the Gariahat and Girish Park areas and near The BSS School on Amir Ali Avenue. Architect Abin Chaudhuri said such billboards could collapse under the impact of rough winds accompanying rain during the monsoon.
A tree whose roots were partially uprooted stand at a 45 degree angle in front of the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. A lamp post stands dangerously inclined on BB Chatterjee Road in Kasba.
Similar sights were spotted on the streets of Salt Lake, Baguiati and Kestopur.
To make matters worse, several roads in Salt Lake — including Broadway, which connects the township with EM Bypass — plunge into darkness after dusk as most street lights have not been working since Amphan. Quite a few broke when the storm was blowing through the city.
On Friday, a resident of HB Block in Salt Lake fell off his scooty after he suddenly slammed the brakes to avoid crashing into a broken lamp post near BD Block in the township.
“The rusted end of the pole stuck out like a spear and was at the same level as my head. I spotted it at the last minute and my scooty skidded off the road, but thankfully I did not hit my head against the pole,” said Rishi Kundu. Residents said broken poles could be spotted in all three sectors of the township. A streetlight hangs precariously over the main road that connects EE Block to GD Block and broken signal poles lie on the roads near the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre on Broadway.
On VIP Road, too, broken poles jut out on the carriageway on stretches along Dakshindari, Lake Town and Kaikhali.
Krishna Chakraborty, the mayor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, said she would look into the issue. “We are still facing an uphill task removing the trees. Nobody has complained about the poles yet but we will send our assessment teams,” said Chakraborty.
A Calcutta Municipal Corporation official said they had removed most of the broken and inclined posts.
“If there are any dangerously hanging electric poles, please lodge a complaint with us. There could be one or two instances of oversight. We have removed most of the dangerously inclined poles,” said the official.
Naturalist Arjan Basu Roy said the CMC should quickly identify the trees that were partially uprooted and either try to restore them or cut them. “Such trees could topple during heavy rain,” he said.",states
Test shed to expedite rites," Patients with Covid-like symptoms dying in hospitals before they could be tested for the disease will no longer be subjected to the test post-death, the state health department has decided.
Officials said the decision had been taken to cut the delay in disposal of the bodies of such patients, which is leading to piling of bodies at morgues.
The death certificates of such patients will have the words “suspected Covid-19 patient” written on them and the bodies will be handed to relatives following the prescribed safety guidelines, the officials said.
The bodies will be cremated at Dhapa or buried at a burial ground in Bagmari.
The officials said the new rule applied to all hospitals, government and private. “We will need a day or two to work out the final order after routing it through the medico-legal cell,” a health department official said.

The NRS Medical College and Hospital switched to the new system on Sunday.
Till now, bodies of patients who showed symptoms similar to that of Covid-19 but could not be tested for the disease would be sent to mortuaries, where they would be kept before samples were collected for the coronavirus test.
Results would usually take between five and six days to come and till then bodies would lie in a heap, sometimes without adequate refrigeration, sources said.
“It usually takes three to four days or even longer for a test result to arrive. By doing away with this test, the waiting time for relatives will reduce,” said Santanu Sen, the chairman of the Rogi Kalyan Samity of NRS Medical College and Hospital.
“The move will also help save Covid test kits. Since the body will be handed over in a leak-proof plastic bag, there is no fear of the spread of the virus.”
The Centre’s guideline states: “The main driver of transmission of COVID-19 is through droplets. There is unlikely to be an increased risk of COVID infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling body”.
Following allegations of bodies rotting at the NRS mortuary, senior doctors from the departments of medicine, microbiology and forensic science discussed the issue with officials of the health department on Saturday.
“A mortuary has a fixed capacity,” said a doctor of the forensic medicine department at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. “If too many bodies come at a time, preserving them becomes a challenge.”
On Saturday, health officials verbally conveyed to all medical colleges the decision to do away with the requirement of Covid tests after death.
The bodies will be handed over in a plastic packet whose exterior will be decontaminated with 1 per cent hypochlorite.",states
"Crash kills ambulance driver, Covid-19 patient"," A youth who had tested positive for Covid-19 at a quarantine centre in East Midnapore’s Kolaghat was killed and a 21-year-old patient from a quarantine centre in Gopalnagar suffered serious injuries when an ambulance carrying them met with an accident on NH6 near Mechhogram on Sunday morning.
The ambulance was en route to the Baroma hospital in Panskura.
Raju Mondal, 32, Kolaghat’s sole Covid-19 ambulance driver, also died in the accident around 6.30am. The trio were left unattended by more than 50 bystanders after they suspected the ambulance to be carrying Covid-19 patients.
“We heard one of the youths say they were going to Baroma. So, we were terrified. We were quite helpless even though they were writhing in pain,” a bystander said on condition of anonymity, adding that several of them had phoned the police.
The accident occurred barely 2km from the Baroma hospital. Sources said later that the driver had put through a call to the hospital, but the bystanders said geared personnel had taken more than an hour to arrive on the scene. By then, Mondal and one of the youths had succumbed to the injuries.

The youth from Gopalnagar is admitted at Boroma with serious injuries. Both the youths were migrant labourers in Delhi and had returned to their respective home towns less than two weeks ago. They were admitted to their respective quarantine centres.
Sources said they had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week and the reports reached the chief medical officer’s department on Saturday night. “What happened is extremely unfortunate. Two migrant labourers who had tested positive for Covid-19 were being ferried to Baroma when one of them, along with the driver, died in a road accident,” said CMO(H) Nitai Mondal.
“This is worse than a nightmare. Not only did my husband test positive, he died two days before he was supposed to come home,” said the wife of the deceased. She has a six-month-old daughter.
“We had been waiting for two whole months to see him,” she added.
Panchayat officials in Baishnabchowk termed the incident “unfortunate”. “The deceased was the sole earning member of the family. Our condolences are with them,” said pradhan Chinmay Maity.",states
"Academic session on hold, says Partha Chatterjee"," It will not be possible to start the academic session now in colleges and universities, education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Saturday.

In Bengal, the academic session starts from mid-July after the publication of the Plus-II board results.
A vice-chancellor present at the meeting said many VCs brought to the minister’s notice that the World Health Organization (WHO) had projected cases would peak in July. “We requested minister Chatterjee to take stock of the situation on the ground and defer the start of the academic session as far as possible,” the VC said.

Given the “inadequate availability” of transport, a student will find it difficult to reach the campuses, another VC said. “We have seen how office commuters have to travel on buses disregarding distancing rules because of few transport options. If students are to travel like this, they will bring health hazard to campuses. It is better to start the session later.”
Minister Chatterjee said the meeting focused on ways to maintain the safety of students, teachers, employees and members of the non-teaching staff.
The government has already decided to keep schools shut in July, he said.
In the meeting it was decided that assessments of final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students would be held without requiring them to visit campuses.
A VC said he and the others suggested the model recommended by the University Grants Commission. “The UGC has said that arts and science students can be assessed by giving 50 per cent weightage to the best of the semester grade point average (SGPA) from previous semesters and the remaining to internal assessment,” he said.
In engineering education, the mode of assessment has been left to Jadavpur University and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology. “They will follow what the All India Council for Engineering and Technology says,” another official said.",states
Restraint call after tourist incident," Hotel owners and tourism stakeholders in north Bengal, already bleeding from losses, are upset over a recent incident in Darjeeling in which some local youths asked a group of Calcutta tourists to leave on the fear that Covid-19 would spread.
A representative of Darjeeling Hotel Owners’ Association, said they need to communicate with local residents.
“It was an undesirable incident. We want tourists to visit Darjeeling. But at the same time, we cannot undermine the concerns of local residents. Now that coronavirus cases are on the rise across the country, we cannot say who is right or who is wrong. We have to build confidence among people here so that such incidents do not recur,” he said.
Some of the hoteliers in the hills appealed for restraint and understanding.
“We need to build confidence among local people in the hills and in the Dooars. Else, the tourism industry can’t turn around,” said a hotelier.
On Thursday evening, Debasish Roy Chowdhury, a businessman who lives in Jodhpur Park, Calcutta, his two brothers, and the wife and two children of one of the brothers — reached Darjeeling in their own SUV. Roy Chowdhury said some local youths asked them where they were from while they were parking the car. After the family checked into a hotel in Chowrasta, another group of local youths reached their hotel with similar queries. “We told them that we are here for two nights,” Roy Chowdhury said. On Friday morning, a group of around 10 youths reached the hotel again, he said. “They asked us why we were in Darjeeling during the pandemic. We told them state and central governments allowed hotels to open and intra- and inter-state mobility. They asked us to leave in 30 minutes,” said Roy Chowdhury.
An employee at the hotel confirmed that some people had asked the tourists to leave.
State tourism minister Gautam Deb said the incident “should not have happened”. “I will speak to the district magistrate, the GTA authorities and others,” said the minister.",states
Manipur honours its brave mothers," On the occasion of Nupi Lan Day (women’s war) at Nupi Lan Memorial Complex here on Thursday, the Manipur government paid rich tributes to the brave mothers of the state who fought against the British forces.
Manipur’s women had risen in agitation against the British regime to protest the mass exploitation and artificial famine in 1904 and 1939. The agitation later evolved as a movement for the constitutional and administrative reform of the erstwhile kingdom of Manipur.
Participating on the occasion, chief minister N. Biren Singh on Thursday assured the gathered audience that the government was fully committed to uphold the dignity and honour of women.
He said the state government has established fast-track courts to deal with crimes against women to deliver speedy justice.
Special women cells have also been opened in all the police stations in the state, he said. Biren Singh said, “It is indeed a matter of pride that many Manipuri women are at the forefront in various fields in the country.”
He said Manipur topped in women ownership of micro, small and medium enterprise businesses in the country.
Manipur women owned 50 per cent of the MSME businesses when compared to the national figure which is about 20 to 30 per cent.
He said there is a need for another Nupi Lan to fight against various problems prevailing in society such as the drug menace and alcoholism.
Deputy chief minister Y. Joykumar Singh, who was also present, stressed on the courage of the mothers who fought against the British and added that “we must not forget their supreme sacrifice”.
Later, a play based on Nupi Lan was staged by joint artistes of the Nupi Lan Memorial Association and Nupi Lal and Khongjom War Memorial Society to mark the occasion.",states
"Curfew in hills, mobile Internet shut"," Trouble erupted in Shillong, compelling the district administration of East Khasi Hills to impose curfew in a few areas of the city from 10pm on Thursday until further orders.
Following unrest in the Northeast in the aftermath of the passage of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, mobile Internet and messaging were suspended for 48 hours from 5pm on Thursday in entire Meghalaya to prevent potential threat to public safety through SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
This was informed by additional secretary to the government of Meghalaya (home, police department) C.V.D. Diengdoh.
The areas that came under curfew were whole of Jaïaw, Mawkhar, Umsohsun, Riatsamthiah, Wahingdoh, Mission, Mawprem, Lumdiengjri, Lama Villa, Qualapatty, Wahthapbru, Sunny Hill, Cantonment, Butcher Road, Mawlonghat excluding localities beyond Umshyrpri bridge.
The areas also included the whole of Khyndai Lad (Police Bazaar), Jail Road, Keatinge Road and Polo.
“In view of the urgency of the matter, this order has been made ex parte,” the deputy commissioner East Khasi Hills district, Matsiewdor War Nongbri, said.
Earlier, violence triggered panic among city residents as goons went on the rampage and torched vehicles.
They vandalised a few shops along the stretch from Motphran to Khyndai Lad on Thursday.
The police said they started attacking shops all of a sudden at Motphran. They ran towards Umsohsun and torched a vehicle parked in front of Hanumanbux Motilal Merchant Shop around 3pm.
They hurled petrol bombs at a vehicle (ML05-N-6001) belonging to the owner of the shop. The fire was doused by a fire tender.
The goons also ran up to Khyndai Lad and set ablaze clothes of a vendor opposite Dreamland cinema hall. Glass shards of some vandalised shops lay scattered on footpaths.
As the news of the incident spread, people, especially shopkeepers, downed their shutters in panic from Ïewduh to Khyndai Lad. Shoppers scurried for safety.
Immediately security personnel were rushed to take control of the area.
The police were deployed in the Motphran and Khyndai Lad areas.
Later, a motorbike was set ablaze at Jaïaw Langsninag and a Maruti van was torched near Presbyterian Church Jaïaw. ",states
Swing between hope & despair," Subhash Barman, 43, was not sure how to react. Having lived his entire life as a refugee, the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill kindled hope of a permanent refuge but fear looms large as protests against the bill are spreading like an epidemic in the state.
Barman is one of the 274 odd Hindu refugee families from erstwhile East Pakistan, settled at Choudhurypara in Bangaon in Kamrup district of Assam in the late 1960s, who were hopeful of getting Indian citizenship after the bill was passed.
Barman was not even born when his father fled to Assam in 1968 from Durgapur area of Mymensingh district of erstwhile East Pakistan after communal riots broke out in the neighbouring country.
Like Barman, the descendants of the 274 families, who now number about 2,000, were left out of the final National Register of Citizens (NRC). Mostly belonging to the Koch Rajbongshi, Hajong and Garo communities, this bunch of Hindu refugee families had applied for inclusion in the NRC but the lone document with them — refugee certificates — were allegedly not accepted by the NRC authorities.
“The question of our identity has become the biggest nightmare now. My father migrated from erstwhile East Pakistan. I was born here in a refugee camp and brought up with the local kids. Our family received land allotments in the late 1980s. With our names stripped off the NRC list, CAB was the lone resort for us. But with protests escalating over the passing of the bill, we are unsure of our future,” Barman said.

Refugee certificates had been issued to them by the then ministry of rehabilitation. The certificates, now faded and brittle, read that they had arrived in Indian due to religious persecution and without any identity documents between 1964 and 1968.
Sushil Das, who still lives in the refugee camp Barman was born in, said, “After living in a refugee camp (Bamunigaon Permanent Liability Home) for a couple of years, the state government allotted small pieces of land to each family. After living here for over half a century and at least two generations later, we don’t consider ourselves to be outsiders. Moreover, our families also reached here before the cut-off date of March 25, 1971. But what’s going to happen to us? We don’t have money for a lengthy and costly legal battle.”
Many families had used the allotted land for cultivation and stayed at the camp.
The ruling BJP said the government had brought in the bill, looking at the crisis of these people. “All these people need to apply for citizenship according to the guidelines set under CAB. If they manage to prove that they fled Bangladesh because of religious persecution or in fear of religious persecution, their application will be assessed before they are granted citizenship,” said BJP spokesperson Rupam Bhuyan.
He said unlike people’s apprehension that hundreds of Hindu Bengalis would enter Assam after the bill is passed, the persecuted Hindu Bengalis are already living in the country.
A BJP internal survey revealed that out of the 19 lakh people who were left out of the final NRC published on August 31, 5,04,800 were Bengali Hindus.
On Monday, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, while advocating the bill in a public function, had said, “There are propaganda and rumours being spread over CAB. No one will enter India from Bangladesh and the bill will enable only some five lakh people to apply for citizenship.”
Sources said the BJP is planning to complete the process of giving citizenship to them before the 2021 Assembly elections.",states
A dirt track too far from democracy," It was not the Maoist diktat but anger against the administration’s decision to relocate polling booths that made most Hesakocha villagers skip voting on Thursday, the third phase of the state elections.
Under Ichagarh Assembly seat, Hesakocha village with 1,267 voters is located along Palna Dam, a picnic spot by the Subernarekha river, in Chandil block, over 50km north-east of Jamshedpur. Its natural beauty makes one forget the rebel curse.
Till 3pm, when voting ended in Ichagarh seat, only seven voters had cast their franchise in polling booth 222 and four more in polling booth 223, all men. Voting score: 11/1,267. That too, in a constituency that clocked a high voting per cent of 73.11.

Both these booths had been relocated near Utkramit Madhya Vidyalaya, Palna, over 13km from Hesakocha.
Asked why only 11 persons voted, gram pradhan Karna Singh Sardar, 46, pleaded helplessness. “Till 2014 Hesakocha residents voted at the Nav Prathmik Vidyalaya that was a 1.5km walk. This year, during Parliamentary polls, the administration located booths to Palna, citing security reasons,” he said. “Even in the height around 40 per cent villagers trudged all the way in the height of summer and voted, but we expected the administration to reconsider its decision by Vidhan Sabha polls. But no, the administration again set up booths at Palna, over 13km from our village, with no public transport and horrible mud roads. So most villagers this time decided against voting.”

Speaking to The Telegraph around noon, he admitted he hadn’t voted too.  CPI(Maoist) posters for “vote boycott to protest police oppression and killing of innocents” are pasted along the walls of thatched huts in the village. But villagers told The Telegraph that their decision had nothing to do with the Maoist diktat.
The gram pradhan admitted that Maoists pasted the posters on Wednesday night and even announced over microphones asking villagers to abstain from voting. “We can’t prevent them from pasting posters. Police seldom come to our village due to bad roads. There is no security. But still, Maoists had no hand in our not going to the polling booths. In 2014 too, Maoists had given a vote-boycott call. But people, including women, had voted then as the polling booth was near,” he said.
Hesakocha forest is used by rebel outfits, including the current area commander Maharaj Pramanik, to move between Chandil-Chowka and Tamar. In 2014, Maoists had beheaded a man from here that they believed was a police informer. They also torched several earthmovers for road construction in 2016 and 2017.
Madi Munda, 43, a farmer of Hesakocha who was one of the rare ones to vote, said he cycled all 13km of the dirt track that passes for a road. “Apni dekhchen road ki rokom achhey (See the state of the road),” he said in the Raarh Bangla dialect used by people here, adding it took him one hour to cycle to the booth and would take him more time to cycle back. “I am tired,” he said. “There’s virtually no road. That’s why no vehicles run. If one wants to walk, it can take three hours, one way. Who will come to vote taking so much trouble? That too during harvest time?”
Seraikela-Kharsawan DC Anjaneyulu Dodde admitted it was inconvenient. “We are aware of poor voting at the two polling booths. We relocated the booths due to security reasons. I will have to check with local officials if they arranged any transport for villagers on voting day today (Thursday),” said Dodde, also the district electoral officer for Ichagarh Assembly seat.",states

"BJP lied on granting scheduled tribe tag, says Morcha chief"," Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Binay Tamang on Saturday accused BJP leaders and his rival Bimal Gurung of “lying” on recognising 11 Darjeeling hill groups as Scheduled Tribes, waving a purported email on a central team’s visit next week.
Tamang cited the email and said it showed the Union tribal affairs ministry would send a committee to Gangtok on Monday to look into similar demands from groups in Sikkim.
The email’s disclosure comes two days after Roshan Giri, a confidant of former Morcha chief Gurung, posted a video of a purported interaction between some leaders of his faction and Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram.
The Union cabinet had on Wednesday approved an amendment bill to recognise some groups in Arunachal Pradesh as STs. There was no mention in the bill of demands for tribal status by the groups in Darjeeling, supported by the Bengal government and all hill parties.
In the clip released on Thursday, Oram is heard saying that if the “Bharat Sarkar” wants, the hill groups can be granted tribal status “overnight”. The purported statement had come amid Parliament’s winter session that ends on January 8.
On Saturday, Tamang cited the email and said: “They talk about passing the bill in the winter session whereas the committee hasn’t even completed its work.”
Tamang warned that “this lie” would cause “the political death of the BJP”. “This lie will cause the political death of BJP, Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri. They must explain why they served lies to the hill people on such an important issue.”
The purported email was sent on Thursday, the same day the video of Oram meeting Gurung faction leaders, along with Darjeeling BJP MP S.S. Ahluwalia, was circulated.
In September last year, Tamang had cited an RTI reply which indicated the Registrar-General of India had twice rejected the Bengal government’s recommendation to grant ST status to the 11 hill groups. ",states
Triangular fight between crorepatis," “Is baar koi Modi lahar nahi hai yahan. Is baar teen logon ke beech siddhi ladayi hai (No Modi wave here this time. Hazaribagh is witnessing a three cornered war on local issues).”
This nugget of political wisdom comes from Banshi Lal, a jhaalmuri (spicy puffed rice) seller of Hurhuru mohalla that falls in Hazaribagh constituency.
The prestigious Assembly seat under Hazaribagh Lok Sabha seat that votes on Thursday is locked in a direct fight between sitting MLA and BJP candidate Manish Jaiswal, Congress’s R.C. Prasad and JVM nominee Munna Singh.
An industrialist, with investments scattered in the education sector, Jaiswal is one of the richest candidates this Assembly elections with declared assets of around Rs 27.04 crore. But he’s up against four more crorepatis in fray, JVM’s Singh with Rs 19.15 crore, Congressman Prasad with Rs 10.64 crore, Lok Janshakti Party’s Mukesh Kumar with Rs 10.83 crore and AIMIM’s Nadeem Khan with Rs 1.21 crore.
Jaiswal, who shifted to the BJP from the JVM in 2013 and won the 2014 Assembly polls piggybacking on the Modi wave, is confident of his victory this time too.
“Maine neta nahin, beta bankar kaam kiya hai,” he says with folded hands during meetings and rallies, as he speaks about “roads connecting villages to the town, sanctioning the ambitious Konar drinking water project in the town”.
But despite Hazaribagh being a BJP stronghold, this time Jaiswal seems to be facing a tough challenge from Singh who is eating into BJP votes. Prasad is banking on traditional Congress votes as well as of those unhappy with the workings of the Raghubar Das government.
Rivals Singh and Prasad often mock the “double-engine sarkar” that the BJP refers to. Singh charged Jaiswal with not looking into whether new roads were made well and alleged widespread corruption in their construction. He pointed out that nothing much had been done to beautify the town’s pride, Hazaribagh Lake. “In paanch salon mein weh sanvedanheen rahe (He remained insensitive during these five years),” alleged the JVM candidate who had formed ‘Team Munna’, a group of young volunteers who arrange blood donations and help the needy.
Prasad, on the other hand, promised to develop the seat taking everyone into confidence as stakeholders.
A voter said this election promises to be interesting. “Jaiswalji is popular and accessible, but Munnaji (JVM’s Singh) has suddenly become rather well-liked among a lot of people. Munnaji was in the Congress.
“When he was denied a ticket, he switched sides and joined the JVM. But Munnaji has his own followers, no matter which party, and has disturbed the BJP’s calculations.”

Ichagarh’s dam-damned in focus once again," Resentment among those displaced for the Chandil Dam over the failure of successive governments to arrange for special rehabilitation compensation package for them is set to be a major issue for the Ichagarh Assembly seat that votes on Thursday.
Thousands of families were displaced for the dam, which was constructed under the Subernarekha Multipurpose Project (SMP) in the 1980s. They are yet to receive proper compensation and rehabilitation.
“Before displacement everyone had a few acres of land but everything was lost after the submergence threat by the Chandil Dam, forcing us to shift to rehabilitation land. But life is miserable,” said Inderjit Sonar, 50, a resident of Khukru rehabilitation centre under Khukru block of Ichagarh constituency.
“There is no proper electricity nor drinking water. We are yet to get a suitable job which was promised by the government. We had hopes from the ‘double-engine sarkar’ but nothing happened even under this government,” Sonar added.
As per the data given by the SMP office, a total of 116 villages were displaced and 19,115 families were affected by the dam. Land for rehabilitation has been allocated to over 1,400 families while compensation amounts of Rs 6.75 lakh have been given to nearly 10,774 families. However, they are demanding special compensation package including proper arrangements like schools, drinking water supply and playgrounds at the 13 rehabilitation centres and a job to one member of each affected family.

“Every year the political leaders put the matter of displaced people on top of their agenda in the run-up to elections but forget them soon post-election,” said Prakash Kumar, a Chandil-based trader.
Sitting BJP MLA Sadhu Charan Mahato said: “I had been raising the issue of Chandil Dam displacement and very soon the Centre is going to announce a big decision on the Chandil Dam displacement issue.”
JMM candidate Sabita Mahato also promised to solve the issue.
“There has been a BJP government most of the time in the state and this time there was BJP government at the Centre and the state but they failed to sort out the issue. Arranging compensation and proper rehabilitation would be top of my agenda this time,” Sabita said.
Ichagarh Assembly seat has 2.92 lakh voters and 337 polling booths. In the 2014 state polls, winning candidate Sadhu Charan of the BJP polled 75,634 votes (42.65 per cent) while Sabita, wife of the late JMM senior leader Sudhir Mahato, polled 33,384 (18.2 per cent). Arvind Kumar Singh polled 28,999 (16.35 per cent). All three are in the fray this year too; there is also Hare Lal Mahato of the Ajsu Party.",states
Veggie bowl wants ketchup to fight poverty," Simaria, an Assembly constituency under Chatra Lok Sabha seat that is among the 17 seats in the third phase of voting, is known as one of Jharkhand’s vegetable bowls, especially for growing tonnes of tomatoes and green chillies.
But instead of selling tomatoes and chillies at throwaway prices to middlemen, farmers, especially the young, want ketchup factories in Simaria, some 120km from state capital Ranchi. A reasonable demand no political party has heeded. Simaria farmers continue to be dependent on rain-fed agriculture and sell their produce at local haats. Produce and prices are unpredictable, poverty is not.
Simaria seat, which has six blocks, including Tandwa that earned a name due to three big coal projects including the NTPC 1980MW Super Thermal Power Plant and CCL’s open-cast projects at Amrapali and Magadh, also has industrial potential. But local youths have not yet been absorbed in these projects (who is saying this?).
For years, youths from Simaria migrate in droves for jobs as under-construction workers, a lucky few pick up a skill on the way such as welding and earn more.
This election, people of Simaria have flagged the issue of job opportunities here. But job opportunities hardly find mention during heated poll rallies. Personality clashes and ideological warfare do.
In the 2014 polls, voters here voted for JVM candidate Ganesh Ganjhu, the brother of Brajesh Ganjhu, the supremo of a banned rebel outfit, the Tritiya Prastuti Committee.
Ganesh, who debuted in 2009 on a JMM ticket, soon shifted to the BJP. But a shock awaited him this elections, when the saffron party denied him a ticket, and fielded grassroots party worker Kishun Kumar Das.
For Das, too, the going has not been easy. With the BJP-Ajsu alliance falling through, BJP’s former junior ally has fielded Manoj Chandra, the son of former Simaria MLA, late Ramchandra Ram.
The twist came when the Congress — which got Simaria as a part of its seat-sharing math with the JMM and RJD — gave a ticket to former MLA Yogendra Nath Baitha. In the fight, the other well-known contestants are CPI’s Binod Bihari Paswan and the JVM’s Ramdev Singh Bhokta, though in all 18 contestants are in the fray. Which specific block each of Simaria’s popular contestants hails from may also have a bearing on votes, a local political watcher said. “BJP’s Das is from Tandwa block, Manoj Chandra of the Ajsu Party and Paswan of the CPI are from Simaria, JVM’s Bhokta is from Giddhore and Baitha from Itkhori. Only Lawalong and Pathalgadda blocks under the constituency have no known faces this polls. If people of each block votes for their local candidate, votes will be divided and the victory margin will be narrow. Moreover, who woos votes of Lawalong and Pathalgadda will become important. Nothing can be said for sure,” said the local expert.
He added with a chuckle: “Actually, if you look at Simaria’s poll history, this seat is one of a kind. So far, voters here have given a chance to the BJP, the Congress, the CPI, the RJD and the JVM.”
A BJP leader claimed they were “fully hopeful of Das winning this seat”, even though he admitted Chandra, Bhokta and Paswan had kept themselves active in public life.
Voters seem to be playing it by the ear. Septuagenarian Nandkishore Yadav of Tandwa said: “Other than green vegetables, Simaria is also known for producing milk, but this naturally blessed place is so poor. We want some concrete plans so that our sons don’t have to leave us and go to cities in search of jobs. We have changed our MLA a number of times but not got what we wanted. We want a ketchup factory and milk processing unit to come up here and put a check on migration.”
Student Aniket Kumar of Chatra College agreed with the old man.
“Badlav ke bawajud bhi is ilaake ki kuch khas tarakki nahi huyi (There have been a lot of changes, but not much progress here),” he said. Asked which way the wind is blowing, he shrugged.

Ranchi's RIMS hospital cleared of squatters," A team from Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) removed encroachments from RIMS premises, Kutchery Chowk, Jaquir Hussain Park and Radium Road on Saturday to ensure smoother movement of traffic through these areas.
During the drive, which started at 11.30am and continued till 5pm, as many as five makeshift kiosks selling breakfast snacks and six hand carts selling fruits were seized from the RIMS premises.
From Kutchery Chowk and Jaquir Hussain Park localities, 18 tables and chairs, three benches, three plastic water containers, 12 pieces of tarpaulin and flower pots, besides other items were seized. These apart, several temporary structures were also removed.
On Radium Road, a tilkut shop that was eating into road space was removed after uprooting bamboo poles used to set it up. Later, the RMC team seized the poles.
A resident of Bariatu, Deepak Kumar was upset at the drive since food vendors, from whom relatives of patients at RIMS bought snacks, were no longer there.
“Relatives of patients admitted at RIMS depend on vendors for fruits and other items of day-to-day use. After the drive, they suffered a lot as they had to go out of the RIMS campus to buy necessities,” he said.
City manager Sourabh Kumar Verma, who led the RMC’s enforcement team, said apart from removing encroachments, they also acted against the use of plastic carry bags.
“After the anti-encroachment drive, we also carried out a drive against plastic bags at Morbadi ground. We imposed fines on vendors found using plastic bags. We collected Rs 4,100 in fines from vendors on Saturday. In the last four days, we collected Rs 17,000 fines,” Verma said.
Verma said the RMC would continue with the drive. “Keeping city traffic in mind, our drive (against encroachers) will continue. No one has the right to disrupt traffic,” he said.",states
Hemant to flag off special train of workers from Dumka," In a first, chief minister Hemant Soren will flag off a special train, carrying around 1500 workers, for BRO projects on Friday – a development that comes close on the heels of the state government's consent to the organisation for recruiting workers from the state provided they register as an employer under the provisions of Interstate Migrant Workmen Act.
Additional Director General of Border Road Organization (BRO), Anil Kumar met Hemant at the Jharkhand Ministry on Thursday and assured to take necessary steps in connection with the government's conditions for sending workers to the frontiers for road construction works, an official from the chief minister's office said.
An MoU will be signed by the BRO officials and Dumka district administration before the workers leave in the special train from Dumka district, a press handout from the government said. Kumar said that BRO has sought the permission of Ministry of Defence to make an MoU between BRO and Jharkhand Labour Department too.
After approval of the Ministry of Defence, the process of MoU will be completed so that the Labour Department can provide proper support to the BRO, Kumar said. While the government did not clarify where the workers were headed, a close aide of the chief minister said that they would be sent to Jammu for road construction works.
Hemant, during the meeting, asked Kumar to maintain transparency in their appointment process and do away with all middlemen. “The workers should be treated well,” he said.
The Jharkhand CM said that workers of Jharkhand should be ensured timely remittance of wages to their bank account every month under the provisions of labour laws. Since these workers do road construction work in difficult terrains under challenging conditions, their safety should also be taken care of, he added.
The BRO has taken all appropriate steps for safety, wages and welfare of the the workers who are going for the road construction work in the border areas of the country, Kumar assured Hemant during the meeting.
The BRO, officials said, had a machinery called 'mates' in place. These mates worked as agents and brought cartels of workers from Jharkhand's poverty-stricken Santhal Pargana region to work in the BRO. A major chunk of the wages were allegedly taken away by the mates and the workers got little money to meet their ends, officials said.
Workers from tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana region of Jharkhand have been serving the BRO since 1970s. However, the process was never regulated. If highly placed sources in the chief minister's office are to be believed, then Defence Minister Rajnath Singh himself asked Hemant to intervene in the matter after the latter apprised him about the state of affairs.
The government's move assumes significance as tension simmers at the Line of Control between India and China. Besides, migrants from Jharkhand, mostly trafficked by slave trading agents, have been subjected to inhuman treatment in other parts of the countries since decades. Jharkhand is also one of the worst-affected states when it comes to human trafficking. ",states
"Public coined Corona Express, not me: CM Mamata Banerjee"," Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday clarified that she had not coined the term “Corona Express” to describe the Shramik Special trains and was only quoting “the public”, a day after Amit Shah had said Bengali migrant labourers would not forgive her for the remark.
“Many of you (the media) misinterpreted… I had never said Corona Express. I had said the public had said. If you take out my statement of the first day (May 29)… I was telling you that the public had been saying so,” said the Bengal chief minister.
“Amphan on one side, Covid-19 on another, a nationwide atmosphere of fear, destruction in work, decimation of plans…. On top of that, amid even a pandemic, instead of standing by the people, rajniti korar j ekta obibechawk durobhishondhi (the inconsiderate malice of doing politics)…. What we can see is that there are only a few who would speak for the people today,” she added, apparently referring to the Union home minister.
Shah had spent considerable time of the BJP’s virtual rally for Bengal on Tuesday, accusing the Mamata government of being apathetic towards the plight of the migrant workers.
He said he had been shocked when Mamata had referred to the Shramik Special trains — meant to ferry migrant workers back to their home states — as Corona Expresses.
“The Bengali migrant labourer will not forgive you for this. The Corona Express will be the reason for your exit,” Shah said. A Trinamul Congress leader said Mamata’s calm clarification — not the one of her signature aggressive counterattacks — on Wednesday suggested her understanding of the seriousness of the issue and how the BJP was strategising to turn the tables of the migrants crisis on her.
The Trinamul chief had mentioned “Corona Express” twice at a news conference on May 29 while blasting the railway ministry for its alleged mishandling of transportation of migrant workers.
“Why must they (the railway ministry) make four people sit in every seat, for 48-72hours? That too from hotspot states. Why can’t the railway ministry give more trains to ensure social distancing? You won’t do it,” she had said.
Mamata went on: “A mother lying dead in the station, her baby roaming about (referring to the Muzaffarpur incident). Why such utter disregard? In the name of Shramik Express, you want to make Corona Express out of these trains?”
At the same news conference, the chief minister later said: “Do you know what the villagers are saying (about approaching Shramik Special trains)? ‘See, Corona Express is coming! Run away, run away!’ What is this? Law and order problems are being caused because of you (railway minister Piyush Goyal).”
Reacting to Mamata’s clarification, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said on Wednesday: “She doesn’t think before she says things and then she does not own up to what she said without thinking. She has been doing this for a long time. I would advise her to think, long and hard, before saying anything.”",states
TMC worker shot dead," Trinamul worker Amir Ali Sardar was gunned down in Basanti, South 24-Parganas, amid murmurs of infighting within the ruling party.
Sardar’s family said he had left home at 4am when some men shot him at close range.
“Aminuddin and his men from the youth Trinamul were hurling bombs. When my brother tried to stop them he was shot,” alleged Ekramuddin, the victim’s brother. Allegedly, Aminuddin works for MLA Saokat Molla and aide Aman Molla. TMC leader Abdul Mannan Gaji accused MLA Molla of “spreading terror in Basanti”.
Aman Molla called the murder a case of family feud.

One Amit counters another with numbers," Amit Shah had a challenger with the same first name on Tuesday.
A visibly prepared Trinamul Congress — assisted by Team Prashant Kishor — took on the BJP’s challenge and worked hard on social media to discredit Union home minister Amit Shah and his virtual rally, before fielding state finance minister Amit Mitra to counter the BJP’s “jumla” with figures.
Lambasting Shah for prioritising electoral politics during the pandemic and in the wake of Cyclone Amphan, Mitra said: “I challenge Mr. Shah… to respond. Where is that cash?”
Trinamul started its “virtual attack” a short while before the Union home minister’s virtual rally began.
Mamata Banerjee’s party, backed by poll strategist Kishor’s Indian Political Action Committee, made hashtags such as #BengalRejectsAmitShah and #BanglaChaaynaAmitShah (Bengal doesn’t want Amit Shah) trend with tens of thousands of tweets on Twitter throughout the event, at times bettering the mega machinery of saffron propaganda.

But the “masterstroke”, according to a Bengal minister, was the idea of fielding state finance minister Amit Shah to call Shah out on his “lies”. “Shah had dared Didi (Mamata) to come out with figures to counter him. Our Amit’s figures badly exposed their Amit’s jumla,” said the minister.
Excerpts from Mitra’s rebuttal:
The tendency to ‘copy’:
On December 30, 2016, the honourable chief minister (Mamata) introduced a scheme called Swasthya Sathi, covering 1.5 crore families, 7.5 crore people, so that their medical needs and treatment are taken care of. Benefit of Rs 5 lakh, with 1,518 network hospitals.
Almost two years later, Ayushman Bharat was suddenly heard of...it was but a poor attempt to copy. Our achievements are there on record. Imitation masters. No thoughts of your own?
The peddling of ‘lies’:
He (Shah) said 7.66 crore people are being helped through the PDS. What is the truth? It is 6.01 crore people. Why was the number inflated? Jhoot, jhoot. Our government here has been giving free food grains to 4.09 crore for three months and will do so for six months. You forgot? Will the people forget, you think?
When we (Trinamul) came to power, there were 75 lakh consumers of power in the state, in 2011. That number is over 2 crore — 1.95 crore households — now. Also probably the only state that is power surplus and no power cuts. Total amount from the Centre since 2011, Rs 5,800 crore for the sector. The state invested Rs 27,500 crore in the same time span.
What Amit (Shah) did omit:
Rs 53,000 crore in dues to state, left unpaid by the Centre. Of that, Rs 36,000 crore, directly for centrally supported schemes and central schemes. Besides, GST dues, food subsidy dues and Rs 11,000 crore in devolution. Rs 1,000 crore given so far for superstorm Amphan. When you are addressing Bengal, release a tranche of that Rs 53,000 crore, Rs 15,000 crore, at least.
The state of the economy:
In 2018, due to demonetisation and unprepared GST...2 crore jobs were lost, according to the CMIE.
Now, for seven consecutive quarters, there has been a decline in GDP growth, all pre-Covid. January to March quarters, 3.1 per cent growth, lowest in 11 years. Unemployment rate, in 2018, was the lowest in 45 years.
Today, after Covid-19, it is 23.5 per cent nationally. In Bengal, it is 17.4 per cent, in big BJP-ruled states Karnataka, 20.4, Uttar Pradesh, 21, Madhya Pradesh, 27, Haryana, 35.
All countries in the world are giving 50 per cent in cash…. What did you give? She (Mamata) had said, “big zero”.
Fiscal stimulus? The US gave 2.2 trillion dollars. Economists are now debating whether it (India’s) was 0.9 per cent of GDP or 1.1 per cent? Ten per cent? A hoax.
Say it, ‘we will not give cash’. Migrant workers stand denied.
The whole world is giving cash. Why? Demand will return. The moment demand returns, supply will respond. As soon as that happens, investments will start.
What is actually happening? Banks are putting money back into the RBI. Yes, banks returned Rs 6.3 lakh crore to the RBI…. Because they do not have faith in India’s leadership…. Hence, risk-averse.
Responding to Mitra’s rebuttal, BJP state unit Dilip Ghosh said later that he does not believe in what the state finance minister has to say.
“I have no faith in those figures. This state government has no credibility,” said the Midnapore MP.",states
Main roads of Calcutta still off limits for cycles," Police have issued a notification allowing free movement of cycles in all roads and lanes in Calcutta except for “main arterial roads and flyovers”.
Earlier, cycling during the day was prohibited in many of the city’s roads and lanes.
The move came a day after the state cabinet approved a policy of allowing cycles on “all small and medium roads” on Monday to ease the hardship of people in reaching offices and other destinations in the absence of adequate public transport.
“Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue a notification mentioning small and medium roads where cycles will be allowed. The decision has been taken considering that people are facing trouble to reach offices or workplaces in the absence of Metro,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said at Nabanna on Monday.
Based on the directive, a notification was issued by the police on Tuesday.

“For the sake of convenience of general public and in view of the restrictions imposed on public transport during the ongoing Corona pandemic… do hereby order that bicycles will be allowed in the lanes and bylanes within Calcutta Police jurisdiction. Restrictions will continue on the main arterial roads, flyovers and any other area as notified from time to time,” the notification signed by city police commissioner Anuj Sharma said.
The notification reminded cyclists that they were not above traffic rules. “Cyclists should obey one-way restrictions and other traffic rules and regulations.”
The order came into effect from Tuesday and will be in force till July 30.
Cycling was completely restricted or limited between 11pm and 7am on 62 roads and flyovers in the city. According to the new rule, cycles will be free to move on these roads without any restriction, the police said.
“There are many lanes in the city that run parallel to the thoroughfares. If people want to commute through these, they will not be stopped,” a traffic police officer said.
Cycles will be allowed on thoroughfares only at crossings to reach a lane, the officer said.
Several Calcuttans have started using cycles, mostly because there is not enough public transport to accommodate everyone going to office. Some have been peddling more than 20km to reach their offices in Calcutta to avoid the discomfort of travelling in an overcrowded bus in the absence of local trains.
Traditionally, slow-moving vehicles like hand-pulled carts, rickshaws and cycles are banned on major roads
because they reduce the speed of other vehicles, the police said.
“Just because a cycle does not have a number plate and cannot be identified it does not mean a cyclist will not be prosecuted if found violating traffic rules,” a traffic police officer said.
Allegations often emerge that the slow moving vehicles do not follow the traffic rules and often result into causing accidents when they illegally come out on the thoroughfares.
By officially allowing cycles on the lanes and bylanes, the police would expect the bicyclists to be more cautious about the traffic rules.",states
Aid for stranded Indian students," They have their back to the wall on foreign soil yet cannot afford to return. The lockdown has jeopardised life for Indian students in British institutes of higher education. Now local Bengali associations along with other Indian communities have come to their aid.
“Our weekly earnings from working for 20 hours have dried up with all shops downing shutters. We rely heavily on that money for our rent and boarding. Without a car I cannot reach the Indian grocery stores as taking public transport has risk of Covid-19 infection. My Indian friends at the London School of Fashion too are surviving on bread and soup,” said Samrat Dutta, a marketing student of Kingston University.
Barsha Bhattacharya, an MBA student, was in even worse state. The Bagha Jatin girl had landed barely three months ago to study at the University of South Wales. She came on a student loan and needed a job. But on March 23, lockdown started in the UK. Back in Calcutta, her father was not getting his salary and suddenly she was on her own. “I am desperate for work. Though it is risky to go out, I have my rent, electricity and gas bills to pay at the apartment I am sharing with three others.”
Things reached such a head that for two weeks she survived only on lunch. “But my health deteriorated so much that I had to start eating at night.”
At this point, she heard of a group created by an Indian students’ union to help those facing financial problems and provide them with free groceries. Soon, a month’s supply reached her and Samrat.
The supplies were funded by a consortium of social groups of non-resident Indians. “Thirty per cent of the foreign students here are Indians. When they could not find work and pay rent, many faced eviction threats. Some faced food scarcity. We are working with the Indian National Students Association and other groups,” said Vikram Banerjee of Basingstoke Hindu Society, who is also a member of Sewa Day.
“In Cardiff, we provided funds with which the association helped students. Some got packets of daal, ata, rice, oil etc. Others got supermarket vouchers,” he added.
In Slough, Adda Slough cooks 150 meals twice a day at the local temple. “We are transferring funds to students’ unions,” said president Nilotpal Mandal. “We connected with students in the west London suburbs. Together with our associates, we have helped about 150 students,” said Prasenjit Bhattacharjee, a member.",states

How a rural stay-safe campaign worked," An imam of a mosque and a leader of the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) in Dinhata subdivision of Cooch Behar are visiting homes in villages with more minority population to spread awareness on the novel coronavirus contagion.
Maulana Adam Shafiullah, the imam of a mosque in Sholmari of Nazirhat in Dinhata, along with Abdur Rauf, the state president of All India Yuva League (the youth’s front of Forward Bloc) who is also from Nazirhat, are roaming the villages to give “correct information” about Covid-19 and distributing food relief and masks among the poor minority families.
Shafiullah told The Telegraph that he felt the task was vital, going by the gravity of the situation. “I felt it important to visit households and tell people how to save themselves from infection. I specifically pointed out that they should refrain from assembling in mosques for weekly prayers to maintain social distancing,” he said.
The imam who keeps moving across villages with Rauf also passed a missive to all imams and muezzins in 36 other smaller mosques under him to step out and campaign among people in their respective areas on social distancing, use of masks and hand-washing. “These three things apart, I also told them to tell people at large to keep senior citizens and children below 10 years indoors,” the imam added.
“We also ask residents to be in constant touch with migrant workers, many of whom are returning homes,” he added.
Rauf added that they asked family members of a returning migrant worker to take the lead and ask the returnee to follow government directives.
Their efforts have led to results in and around Nazirhat, Dinhata-II block, with a population of over 50,000 with a 45 per cent minority population.
People did stay indoors, even during Id, and there were hardly any iftar parties, which otherwise is a common trend during Ramazan.
As of now, Dinhata has reported around 100 Covid-19 cases but many have recovered. The most important takeaway from the duo’s efforts, Rauf felt, was that returning migrant workers followed the government’s directives of quarantine. “People were aware, they acted responsibly, and that’s why the spread of the infection was not as rapid as it might have been in the area.”
Rauf added that they went to Muslim and Hindu households alike.
“In fact, we handed over relief materials to some families of Hindu priests who were in distress as the temples were closed till last week,” he said.",states
Flames leap from oil well," A massive fire broke out at the Baghjan oil well after an explosion on Tuesday afternoon and spread to nearby areas, burning houses and trees and prompting a second round of exodus after the recent blowout-driven evacuation.
Television images showed flames leaping 30-40ft into the sky and ending in a plume of black smoke that people said was visible from Tinsukia town, 15km away.
A fire-fighter from ONGCL suffered “minor injuries” in the blaze, which set off “violent” protests that led to a few Oil India employees being “manhandled” and a few vehicles damaged, an Oil India official said.
A company official said “the army has been deployed to assist the police and maintain order” while the chief minister’s office said the air force was on standby to help fight the fire, if necessary. Some 20 fire tenders were trying to control the fire in the evening.
The 1,610 families evacuated after the May 27 blowout of crude and natural gas and lodged in relief camps 1.5km from the site were hurriedly shifted to new camps 15km away, Baghjan resident Hemanta Moran said, indicating the size of the area endangered by the blaze.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Many others from nearby areas were seen leaving on foot and on pickup vans and trucks after the flames began leaping around 1.30pm and damaged “20 to 25” empty houses of the already evacuated families, local people said.
Oil India said the fire broke out during clearing operations in the well, and while plans to control the continuing blowout were being chalked out with a team of three just-arrived experts from Singapore.
It said that following the fire, the entire capping operations would now take four weeks.
The experts from the Singapore-based company, Alert Disaster Control, had arrived in Duliajan, 45km from Baghjan, in the early hours of Monday.
Local people said the fire posed a threat to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park, about 300 metres from the oil well, and the Maguri-Motapung Beel (wetland), 500 metres away.
With local anger, already simmering over the continuing blowout since May 27, threatening to explode after the fire, the CRPF has also been sent in to help maintain order.
Personnel from the NDRF and SDRF are helping with the relief operations at the site, about 530km east of Guwahati.
“Although the fire is still raging, we have managed to contain the spread of the fire to the peripheral areas,” an Oil India official said late in the evening.
He said that because of the fire, the gas and its condensate (chemical spray) would no longer trouble the nearby areas.
Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal spoke to defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union home minister Amit Shah and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan to seek help in dousing the fire.
A CMO statement said Sonowal had requested Rajnath to “deploy the air force for controlling the fire”, and that Pradhan later told him the air force was on standby.
Oil India said that its officials and those of the ONGC were being evacuated from nearby areas.
“Once the situation is normal, the experts from Alert and the staff of OIL/ONGC will move to the site. Oil and ONGC were to mount a joint operation on Thursday to cap the well,” it said.
“The situation demands (an) arrangement of large quantities of water, installation of high-discharge pumps and removal of debris. All the operations as per Alert will take about four weeks. Efforts will be made to reduce this timeframe as much as possible.”
Nirantar Gohain, a local environment activist, said the ecology would be “under threat” if the well were not capped soon.
Congress MLA Debabrata Saikia, leader of the Opposition in Assam, said the state government should pressure the Centre to “bring in American experts, such as (those from) the company founded by the late (oil well fire-fighter) Red Adair to control the situation, instead of some relatively unknown Singaporean company”.
Saikia demanded immediate compensation for the affected families.",states
Reopening of places of worship in abeyance," The Meghalaya government, along with various religious groups, on Tuesday decided to postpone the decision to reopen places of worship.
On June 5, the first meeting between the government and representatives of religious groups decided to reopen the places of worship from June 14 onwards. These places were shut since the first lockdown began towards the end of March.
However, after the second meeting held here on Tuesday, it was decided that the reopening of such places should be kept in abeyance at least till the end of this month.
“A majority of the religious leaders representing churches, temples, mosques felt that we should postpone the decision of reopening the places of worship from June 14,” chief minister Conrad K. Sangma said.
He said the decision to reopen the places of worship was revisited keeping in mind the priority that has been given to health and safety, and the fact that many stranded citizens are still on their way back to Meghalaya.

Communal harmony at Giridih funeral," A funeral in Giridih proved that communal harmony is still a cherished value.
When Lakhia Devi, the septuagenarian mother of Jogeshwar Turi died in Giridih on Saturday afternoon, his Muslim neighbours were first to reach their house and many of them accompanied him to cremate his mother on Sunday.
Though Jogeshwar’s relatives who live in far away could not reach, others living in nearby areas reached for the funeral. They were joined by Jogeshwar’s Muslim neighbours. “This is nothing new as we have always been very close to one another in our tola (locality),” said Sarfaraz Ansari, a youngman of the locality, adding they were peacefully living in the area “just like relatives”.
Jogeshwar is one of the two Hindu families living in Muslim dominated Nicha Tola of Paharidih village under Giridih muffasil police station area though more Hindus reside at Upar Tola, the other locality of the same village. He further informed that they all stand by one another whenever such need arises.
Lakhia Devi was unwell after she suffered a paralytic attack a week ago and breathed her last on Saturday afternoon.
“The funeral was taken out on Sunday after her relatives arrived,” Ansari informed, adding many of them such as Mohammad Shamshad, Mohammad Bilal and Mohammad Tahir joined the funeral procession, did whatever was required and stayed till the cremation was over.
They had attended the cremation even when Jogeshwar’s father who died a few years ago, Ansari further said, adding their Hindu neighbours also do the same whenever there is bereavement in a Muslim family. They also join one another whenever there is a happy occasion, he said.
“We actually also had a sense of gratitude to the lady,” Ansari further said, adding she once acted as a midwife in the village and had helped many women of the village during their labour and even took care of and nursed the newborns. “Some of my uncles got such nursing from her,” he further said, indicating they were thus sort of indebted to the deceased woman.",states
Luxury hotels of Calcutta try to lure customers with discounts and benefits," Eager to get their customers back, most luxury hotels in Calcutta are doing what they have seldom done before.
Discounts of up to 50 per cent on room tariff and other facilities such as spa and sauna, concession on food rates at restaurants, flexible reservation and cancellation policies, digital menu cards replacing physical ones — the city’s star addresses opened on Monday after 74 days with a range of offers aimed at restoring the pre-Covid occupancy.
The tariff of a deluxe twin room at JW Marriott is Rs 9,500 per night (without taxes). The EM Bypass hotel is offering almost half the price between June 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, if the booking is done this month, according to its website.
The condition is that the bookings are non-transferable, meaning the person booking a room cannot transfer the booking to another individual.
The Oberoi Grand is offering a 20 per cent discount on room tariff if the booking is made through its website.
A customer ordered a 12-inch thin crust chicken pizza at The Bridge, a restaurant at The Park, on Monday. It cost Rs 1,210, instead of the usual price of Rs 1,593 (both include 18 per cent GST). The discounts on other food items ranged between 15 and 20 per cent.
Hospitality majors such as Marriott, Taj Bengal and The Park said the idea was to increase the footfall after a prolonged lockdown and cater to the needs of the customers looking for food and room while keeping in mind the liquidity constraints.
Not everyone has gone for a reduction in tariff — some are packaging benefits as part of the booking. Taj Bengal, for instance, is offering daily hotel credit of Rs 3,000 per room per night, which can be used for food and beverage, spa and laundry. The hotel is also offering upgrades to the next room category (except suites) based on availability and 20 per cent discount on salon and spa as part of the booking.
The hotel is also offering flexible cancellation to avoid a penalty of one night, plus applicable taxes and fees, said officials.
A major change is replacement of physical menu cards at restaurants in the hotels with digital ones. A guest has to scan a QR code to get the digital menu card on his or her mobile phone.
“This is an innovation keeping in mind the safety and sanitisation requirements. It also has the benefit of tweaking the menu without the need to reprint,” said chef Sharad Dewan of The Park, Calcutta. It also saves cost.
A key concern of most hospitality chains is the non-availability of certain items such as imported cheese, salmon, tuna etc. The other concern is that alcohol cannot be served, based on a government directive.
The footfall at many of the star restaurants did not cross 20 per cent on the first day. The managements hope the offers will help push up the footfall.
“We have introduced a scheme called ‘Save Now Stay Later’ across all our hotels in India. The scheme offers discounts ranging from 30 to 50 per cent. While the scheme is flexible, it’s not transferable. The offer is for a limited period and we will go back to normal rates,” said Gaurav Singh, general manager, JW Marriott, Calcutta.
The hotels have also adopted a range of hygiene norms and are conveying them to prospective customers through various platforms to allay their concerns over contracting the coronavirus.
“We are excited and relieved with the opening of our restaurants, at the same time we also understand that we have to move forward with caution and ensure complete safety for our guests and associates.... Hopefully the situation would gradually improve,” said Manish Gupta, general manager, Taj Bengal.",states
"10,000 homeless as wave wrecks dam"," At least 10,000 people of two gram panchayat areas were rendered homeless on Monday after a 50-metre stretch of a thatched dam on river Goureshwar was swept away by a fresh tidal wave during the early hours in Hingalganj of Hansnabad block of North 24-Parganas.
The dam in Rupmari panchayat area, which suffered serious damage in Cyclone Amphan on May 20 and was being repaired, was swept by a heavy tidal wave that triggered a flood-like situation.
Large tracts of farmland and fish ponds suffered fresh damage due to inflow of saline water of the Goureshwar, which is an estuarine river.
A school run under the Integrated Child Development Scheme also went under water.
The district administration shifted a large number of people to shelter homes and gave them relief materials. However, several people complained that relief materials stayed elusive till Monday afternoon. “Till afternoon (Monday) no one from the district administration offered us food or relief material,” a villager told The Telegraph.
The villagers, however, had an appeal to the government — repair the dam well.
“Let us remain without food or relief items, but repair the dam in a manner that the situation doesn’t recur every year,” said homemaker Chandana Maiti Bera.
Chandana was echoing what many villagers feel — that the administration has not done enough to repair the thatched dam the past fortnight even though the tidal wave was expected to hit the river. Residents have questioned the administration for banking on patch work rather than coming up with a permanent solution to the problem.
“Damage to the dams due to tidal waves has become a recurring problem. We always live in fear of losing everything. The Amphan this year washed away our homes...We were trying to get back to normal life, but the tidal wave during the past few days washed away our efforts. Unfortunately, the irrigation department failed to repair the dam after it was damaged by Amphan on May 20,” said Prasanta Mandal, a resident in Rupmari.
Chandana said she and many others were living on a raised road after Amphan left them homeless. “We feared a fresh tidal wave would not just damage the dam, but the road on which we had taken shelter. Our worst fears came true early on Monday. We are worried that the situation would worsen during monsoon.”
Hansnabad panchayat samiti pradhan Archana Hira, however, tried to refute the allegations of delay in repairing the dam. “The dam was not strong enough since it suffered damage in Amphan. We could not get much time to repair it despite our efforts,” she said.
A source said the local administration had told minister Suvendu Adhikary about the “weak dams” when he visited the area last week so that major repairs could be done.
A state irrigation department official in Basirhat said they were “helpless”. “We could do little as the tidal wave has been coming for days,” he said.",states
Nod for cycling on select roads of Calcutta," The state cabinet has approved a policy of allowing bicycles on all small and medium roads in Calcutta and other major urban areas to ease the hardship to reach offices and other destinations in the absence of metro and local trains.
“The Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue a notification mentioning small and medium roads where bicycles will be allowed. The decision has been taken considering that people are facing trouble to reach offices or work in the absence of metro,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said at Nabanna on Monday.
“People’s lives are most important.... Busy roads will be avoided to avert accidents. The Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue the list of roads after careful consideration.”

Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma told The Telegraph: “We are working on a plan so that safety of cyclists is not compromised and... there is no disturbance to normal flow of traffic in the city.”
Cycling is banned 24X7 on 22 thoroughfares in the city, including Park Street, Theatre Road, Camac Street, Red Road, Lalbazar Street, Council House Street, Rawdon Street and all flyovers. On 40 other thoroughfares such as Chowringhee Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Central Avenue and some other roads, cycling is allowed from 11pm to 7am.
During the lockdown, many people had cycled to work on these thoroughfares. Police sources said traffic cops had not prosecuted them on humanitarian grounds.
“Usually, slow moving vehicles like a bicycle reduces the speed of other vehicles. That is the primary reason why they are not allowed on major thoroughfares. But we made an exception and did not prosecute cyclists during the lockdown as public transport was absent,” said an officer in the traffic police.
There are separate cycle tracks in several parts of the country for free movement of cycles.
Sources said the proposal — a temporary one because of non-availability of adequate public transport — was put forward by the heads of various departments after it was found that many employees could not reach office on Monday. Government offices started functioning with 70 per cent employees during the day.
Various employees unions said attendance in different departments was around 60 per cent on Monday.
“Many government employees stay in parts of North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly and depend on local trains and metro to reach office. These services are not available, so many employees could not reach office,” said a leader of the Trinamul-backed employees union.",states
Risk zones in Bengal locked till June 30," The state cabinet on Monday decided to extend the lockdown in Bengal’s containment zones till June 30 on the lines of the Centre’s recent notification.
“The lockdown (in containment zones) will continue till June 30,” said Mamata Banerjee on Monday after the cabinet meeting at Nabanna.
Earlier, the state government had decided to extend the lockdown in containment zones till June 15.
But the Centre, ahead of Unlock 1.0, said while containment zones would be defined by state governments, lockdown in the zones will last till June 30.
Mamata on Monday also said that all the migrant workers who had wished to come back to Bengal would be back by June 10 as all 235 trains specifically scheduled to bring them back would reach by then.
“Eleven lakh people (in all) will be back by June 10. Already, nine to 9.5 lakh people are back,” she said.
A government official said that the large number of returnees meant a rise in Covid infections in Bengal.
Also, the state government had to arrange Covid-19 swab sample tests and quarantine centres in bulk for the returnees, which posed a challenge in terms of volume and logistics, but they were doing their best.",states
Bengal govt urges operators to run more buses," The state government on Sunday urged private bus and minibus operators to ensure more buses from Monday when more people will be out on the roads as offices, malls and restaurants open.
Some private operators, however, insisted on an immediate fare revision before rolling out more buses and minibuses.
At a meeting with private operators on Sunday, transport department officials asked bus owners to let them know in writing why they wanted a fare hike while explaining income and expenditure. But before that bus owners should ensure more buses on the roads from Monday, officials told the operators at the meeting.

Transport officials said they would run around 1,100 buses from Monday, scaling up the fleet strength by almost 400 more buses.
“We will try and bring out more buses… most buses require mechanical overhauling and owners don’t have money to do that,” Rahul Chatterjee of Bus Minibus Samonnoy Samity said. “We have told the government that all buses won’t be out on the roads in the absence of a fare hike.”
“Several workers are still reluctant to resume duty. Owners haven’t seen enough returns to feel enthused to run more buses,” Pradip Narayan Bose of West Bengal Bus Minibus Owners Association said.

Woman and mother die in quick succession in Calcutta," A 56-year-old woman and her mother who had appeared frail to a doctor when he last visited them on Thursday died within hours of each other in Salt Lake’s BE Block on Saturday night.
Sharmistha Kar Purkayastha, 56, former wife of state security adviser Surajit Kar Purkayastha, and her mother Papia De, 77, were found in critical condition at their BE-71 home by some of their relatives on Saturday evening, police said.
A doctor on call examined them and announced they had died. They were declared dead at Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital.
Some relatives of the deceased women had earlier tried to get them admitted to a hospital because they had “Covid-19 like symptoms”, the police said. They apparently preferred staying at home.
The relatives had reached their home on Saturday evening to persuade them to go to hospital.
“On Saturday evening, when some relatives went to visit them, they found Papia De lying motionless…. Sharmistha Kar Purkayastha’s condition was very serious. A doctor reached their home around 9pm and said both had passed away,” Surya Pratap Yadav, deputy commissioner of the Bidhannagar commissionerate, said. “The relatives took both of them to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional hospital where both were declared brought dead.”
Preliminary investigations suggested the relatives had tried to get them admitted to hospital on Friday but failed because the women were unwilling to leave home, Yadav said.
The bodies underwent post-mortem on Sunday. Preliminary reports have ruled out foul play, the police said.
Sharmistha, an MSc in biology with a postdoctoral degree in antibiotics, had worked as the principal of Gyan Bharati Balika Vidyalaya. She had joined the BJP in 2014.
“Sharmistha Purkaystha (wife of Surajit Kar Purkaystha) was found dead in her apartment. She was a member of our party and we demand an independent inquiry into her death,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.
Papia, who had suffered a fractured femur, had returned home from hospital 15 days ago. Some neighbours suspected they had Covid-19 and alerted the civic body.
Acting on an alert from the local councillor, chief medical officer of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation Kusum Adhikary went to check on the women on Thursday. “Sharmistha could barely move while her mother was completely bedridden and did not respond when I called out to her,” Adhikary told Metro on Sunday. “Her temperature was normal. But she complained of feeling feverish, weak and drowsy.”
Adhikary said he had told the mayoral council member in charge of health, Pranay Kumar Ray, to get them admitted to hospital.
Ray said they had not shifted the women to a government-run hospital because of their “background” and the fact that they would be held responsible in case anything went wrong. “They are high profile. All the blame would have come on us if anything went wrong.”
Basab Aich, a resident of BE Block, said the women rarely interacted with neighbours. “The news of their deaths has sparked fear of infection among neighbours.”

"Covid-19 cases rise, as do tests & recoveries"," Bengal had yet another record-shattering day on Sunday with 449 new Covid-19 cases — the highest 24-hour rise — that took the total number of cases past 8,000.
This comes only two days after Bengal breached the 7,000 mark, five days since 6,000 and eight days since the milestone of 5,000.
The cases — 8,187, till 9am on Sunday — doubled from 4,000 in 12 days. The doubling from 2,000 had taken 15 days.
A month ago, the watershed moment of May 8, after which the return of migrant workers and others, stranded elsewhere in the country, started in large numbers, the figure was 1,678.
The 13 deaths reported on Sunday took the toll of deaths directly from Covid-19 to 324. There were, till April 30, 72 other deaths of infected people, attributed to comorbidities by the state government.
Of the 396 total deaths, Calcutta alone accounted for 254.
Chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her government have repeatedly attributed the rise to the return of the stranded, the number of which has crossed over 10 lakh. Most are from high-incidence states, many are infected, and an alarming number are asymptomatic.
“Didi (Mamata) has been livid with the BJP-led Centre for rushing lakhs into the state in a matter of days, without planning, after keeping them stranded for months, without food, treatment, money or shelter…. Now, given the way they are being sent back, the (spread of) infection is virtually guaranteed,” said a minister.
Of the 449 new cases (till 9am on Sunday) 428 — over 95 per cent — were from districts experiencing a high volume of returnees. The total number of active Covid-19 cases is 4,488 now. On May 8, it was 1,195.
West Midnapore reported 84 cases, while Calcutta reported 74, North 24-Parganas reported 68, Howrah and Hooghly reported 37 each.
Bengal now has 11,806 quarantine facilities for returnees on Shramik Special trains, which now have 138,419 returnees, more than another 154,682 on home quarantine and 22,695 in other 582 state-run quarantines. On May 8, the state had 4,964 people in institutional quarantine and 9,576 people in home quarantine.
As of Sunday, 247,425 people successfully completed quarantine.
The release following the cure of 184 persons took the number of recoveries to 3,303. The number was 323 on May 8.
Another “good news”, according to the minister, was the rise in tests. With 9,786 tests reported on Sunday — yet another record in 24 hours — Bengal’s tests per million count went past the 3,000 mark. The total number of tests is 271,074.",states
Some migrants await dry ration in Jharkhand," The torment of migrants does not seem to end even after coming to their home state as alleged gaps in execution of promises at the ground level has pushed some of them to the brink of starvation.
Babloo Singh, 36, a migrant worker in Kurun panchayat of Bhandariya block in Garhwa district of Jharkhand, stares at a bleak future with his family of three daughters, wife and parents surviving at the mercy of Good Samaritans of their village.
“Hum kuch mahine se taklif main the par gaon aa kar laga ki kuch kar lenge apne parivar ke liye. Par 14 din quarantine main ho gai, ghar main khane ka kuch nahin, koi sarkari madad nahin mile, karza ka bojh bhi badh gaya hain (I have spent the past few months in pain but after returning to my native village had hoped that I would do something to support my family. But I have been staying in quarantine and there is nothing to feed the family. There is no government help and to add to the problem, the burden of borrowed money from others has increased so much),” said Babloo.
He worked as a contract worker in Chennai on a daily wage of Rs 300 in an engineering plant.
Babloo claims the contractor who had him and others to Chennai has withheld their payments for April and May after the plant shut down in March because of the lockdown.
“Do mahine se payment nahin diya, kisi tarah hum log Jharkhand pahunche, par yahan bhi koi madad nahin mil raha (We were not paid salary for two months. We managed to reach Jharkhand somehow but even here there is no support),” said Babloo who returned on May 24 in a special Shramik train from Chennai to Ranchi.
He was taken to his village on a special bus from Ranchi and was kept in Uchha Vidyalaya in Kurun, Garhwa.
Similar is the condition of Mahto Munda in Rahada panchayat of Kanke block near Ranchi.
“I used to work as a labourer in Visakhapatnam and returned on May 20 by a special train. I am the only earning member and I used to send money for my parents. We were not paid a salary for April and May and had no option but to stay in home quarantine for 14 days.
“As I could not go outside because of the quarantine protocols, I had no option but to eat one time a day with whatever was available in the house. We had no option but to borrow money from known persons for our survival. There has been no government help apart from the free train service,” said Mahto, 25.
On May 13, Jharkhand home and disaster management department secretary Amitav Kaushal had written to deputy commissioners in all the 24 districts to ensure that a one-time dry ration food packet is given during home quarantine period. The dry ration packets would have included 10kg rice, 1kg arhar dal, 1kg chana dal, 1 litre mustard oil and 1kg salt.
“All those undergoing home quarantine had been advised to download the Jharkhand Bazar App so that dry ration packets would be provided at their home from their nearest ration shops. I do not know how the migrants could not get dry ration. We are yet to receive any specific complaints. However, we would look into the issue,” said Ranchi deputy development commissioner Ananya Mittal.
Repeated calls Garhwa deputy commissioner Harsh Mangla and deputy development commissioner Naman Priyesh Lakra on their mobile phones on Saturday went unanswered.
An advocate in Ranchi Anup Kumar Agarwal said he would be lodging a PIL in this connection at Ranchi High Court on Monday.
“We have collected details of several migrant workers from across Jharkhand who used to spend their home quarantine period in abject poverty because of the lack of government support. I would be filing a PIL in this connection at the high court on Monday,” said Agarwal.
Special secretary state disaster management Manish Tiwari promised to take up the issue with the respective deputy commissioners.

Hiss! Slithery visitor at Burdwan quarantine centre," An unwelcome guest on Friday — a poisonous snake — in the toilet of a quarantine centre in East Burdwan’s Kalna, has rattled a group of 45 migrant workers, including two women, staying there.
The migrants, quarantined at a school building that has been turned into a quarantine centre, said the snake was a krait.
Since Friday night, the quarantined migrants have been demanding adequate lights and cleaning of the Haldipara RC High School building.
Quarantined inmate Indrajit Pal said he was spared a “sure snakebite” as he had switched on his mobile phone’s flashlight when he entered the toilet on Friday night. “I was barely two inches away from the snake. I was saved as I had turned on my phone’s flashlight in the absence of any light in the toilet. I am lucky to be alive,” Pal said.
He added that none of them at the quarantine centre had slept the night.

The Bengal state government has made it mandatory for migrants coming from five states, including Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat, to stay institutional quarantine for 14 days to contain the spread of Covid-19.
An official in Kalna said hundreds of school buildings had been acquired overnight for institutional quarantine after the flow of migrant workers returning to Bengal increased since mid-May.
“The schools remained closed since mid-March and had not been cleaned. As it is raining almost every day, snakes are trying to take shelter in such buildings. We have directed the local BDOs to ensure that the centres are free of snakes,” said the official.
A source said the 45 migrant workers institutionally quarantined at the Kalna’s Haldipara school since the past 10 days, had returned from states such as Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana.
“We did not come back to die of snakebite. The bathroom and a large part of the school campus don’t have lights. We informed the local panchayat member on this but nothing was done. We are just too scared,” said Rocky Mondal, who returned from Delhi 12 days ago.
Trinamul gram panchayat member Sanyasi Das admitted to the problem: “I have informed the local administration. There is a pond beside the school and I think snakes are coming from there.”
Kalna SDO Suman Sourav Mohanty said local block officials were looking into the problem.
However, the problem of snakes is not restricted to one quarantine centre. A migrant labourer, Biswajit Khara, was bitten by a poisonous snake at the Jadupur Primary School in West Midnapore and had to hospitalised on June 3 night. “He was saved as he was taken to the hospital within half an hour,” a health official said.
In both Kalna and West Midnapore, inmates managed to kill the snakes.

People who depend on a day’s work for a day’s meal have been hit hard by the lockdown, which had come into force on March 25 to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Among such people, the differently abled have been hit the hardest, said social workers who organised the aid on Saturday.
Pannalal Chakrabarty, 42, was one of the recipients. Chakrabarty, a resident of Durgapur in South 24-Parganas, was born with visual impairment and by the time he reached his teenage years, he was 100 per cent blind.
Chakrabarty and his wife Kanaklata, also blind, sold incense sticks on local trains between Sealdah and Ballygunge. With suburban train services suspended for over two months, the couple are done with stretching their little savings to the last penny.
“We used to earn Rs 150 to 200 every day. The savings we had is over. For the past two weeks, we have been living on help from NGOs,” said Chakrabarty.
Each recipient got a 15kg kit that contained rice, dal, potato, oil, soybean and biscuits. A pair of masks were also provided to each recipient.
“The stock should last a fortnight for a family of four,” said Chiranjit Gayen, a representative of Goonj, the NGO that provided the kits.
The recipients were selected by The Society for the Welfare of the Blind, a non-profit that works for the uplift of people with visual impairment.
“Many people who have lost their livelihood because of the lockdown are trying to make a living by switching professions. A mechanic is now selling vegetables. But blind people find it difficult to switch professions,” said Biswajit Ghosh, the secretary of the NGO. He is principal of the Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy in Narendrapur.
The NGO gave Rs 300 to each of the recipients.
The organisers went to several places in the city and its southern fringes — Baruipur, Garia, Tollygunge Phari, Ballygunge station, Kasba and Ultadanga — to distribute the kits on Saturday.
Debasish Das, 48, was one of the recipients of Saturday’s aid. A resident of Kalyanpur, the station after Baruipur in the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour section, Das supplies phenyl bottles to stalls at Jadavpur and Ballygunge stations.
“Some stores outside the station are open. But there is no way I can reach them without the train services,” said Das. “I worked hard for a living but there was a dignity in that life. Life dependent on charity is miserable,” he added.",states
Three-official panel on bus fares," The state government has set up a three-member committee to look into the demand for a hike in the fares of buses and minibuses.
The committee is made up of three officials of the transport department and the mandate is to look into all demands of the bus and minibus operators, including bringing workers within the insurance net and waiving fees for certain tests.
“The committee will start working from next week and will submit a report to the government within 30 days,” said an official of the transport department. “To begin with, the committee will start hearing out representatives from different bus and minibus unions.”
Private bus operators had demanded setting up of a regulatory commission that would decide on revision of fares after considering different aspects of the industry. Last week, the transport department had agreed to the demand before requesting bus operators to resume services.",states
Buffer or clean zone? Find out online," A list identifying all Covid “affected”, “clean” and “buffer” areas in the city has been uploaded for the first time, helping Calcuttans figure out the specific restrictions and relaxations applicable to them and others at a time the lockdown is being eased.
The list of affected, clean and buffer areas can be found on wb.gov.in> district wise affected areas and buffer areas> know more> Kolkata.
Similar lists for the districts are also posted on the website.
Until now, only containment zones had been identified online. Now, the additional categories of “clean” and “buffer” are also specified.
The Bengal government has divided a Red Zone (any district from where at least one Covid-19 case has been reported) into affected areas, buffer areas and clean areas.
An area from where no Covid-19 case has been reported in 21 days is tagged clean, while one from where at least one case has been reported during this period is tagged affected.
The immediate vicinity of an affected area is called buffer area if it is not clean.
Relaxations of lockdown restrictions depend on whether a locality is in a clean, buffer or an affected area. No shop can be opened in an affected area/ containment zone and no one can enter or leave that area without a valid reason.
On the other hand, a large number of activities are allowed in clean areas. In buffer areas, all activities that are allowed in a clean area are permitted, but with 25 per cent staff strength.
Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said the expanse of an affected area had been reduced for the benefit of people in the neighbourhood. As many offices have opened, the civic body and the police have jointly made a plan to ensure as few houses are sealed as possible.
If someone living in a housing complex with multiple towers test positive, only the tower where the person lives will be considered a containment zone or affected area. People living in this tower will remain confined in their homes for 14 days. Those living in other towers of the complex can go out for work, said an official.
The entire housing complex will be considered a buffer area.
For a large standalone building, the entire building where a person tests positive will be classified as an affected area but not the lanes around it or adjacent buildings.
In some cases, police and the CMC are considering only the flat or the floor as an affected area. Here the buffer area will include 10 buildings on all sides.
For a small standalone building, the entire lane will be classified as an affected area if the building where someone tests positive is in a small lane.
If the lane is quite long, five buildings on all sides will come under affected area. Ten buildings on all sides will be part of the buffer area.",states
"Bengal aims for 15,000 Covid-19 tests a day"," The state health department has decided to increase the number of daily Covid-19 tests from around 9,500 now to 15,000 by the end of this month, officials said.
Health department officials said there was a need for more tests because migrant workers had started returning in hordes from other states to different parts of Bengal.
A number of steps are being taken to ramp up Bengal’s testing capacity.
From next week, the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, which has been converted into a tertiary-level hospital to treat Covid-19 patients, will start conducting the RT-PCR test for the novel coronavirus.
“A formal approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research for the RT-PCR test at the laboratory set up at the College Street hospital reached the state government earlier this week. The medical college will start collecting samples from next week,” a health department official said.
Now, swab samples of patients admitted to the hospital are sent to the School of Tropical Medicine for tests.
“Once the new laboratory starts functioning, the School of Tropical Medicine will be ready to accept samples from other places. The detection of coronavirus cases at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital will now be faster,” the health department official said.
An RT-PCR machine was installed at SSKM Hospital three days back, taking the number of machines to detect the novel coronavirus in swab samples at the premier government referral hospital to three.
The machine that has been installed at SSKM was lying defunct at ESI Hospital in Maniktala. The health department brought in technicians from Chennai to get it repaired.
The hospital has been conducting over 1,000 tests every day, the highest followed by Niced Beleghata and the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri.
The health department has bought six RT-PCR machines, which will be distributed to various testing centres by next week. “The medical colleges in Diamond Harbour, Rampurhat and Cooch Behar will get one machine each,” an official said.
The health department has placed an order to buy a fully-automated testing machine from a US-based company that could carry out RNA extraction and test samples without any human intervention. Officials said the machine could perform over 3,000 tests every day.

"Infections, recoveries soar in Bengal"," Bengal on Saturday reported 435 new Covid-19 cases, a yet another 24-hour high.
However, the state also clocked a 24-hour high in daily testing, with 9,771 tests.
This apart, the total number of cured cases went past 3,000, with 207 releases till 9am, according to the state bulletin. The total number of cured cases rose to 3,119, a rise of 11 times since 296 a month ago.
The recovery rate — which more than doubled from 19.12 per cent a month ago — was 40.3 per cent on Friday. Even a week ago, it stood at 38.4 per cent. Calcutta reported the most recoveries, 1,073.
However, the 17 deaths reported on Saturday took the toll directly from Covid-19 past the 300 mark, to 311.
Of the 435 new cases, 419 or over 96 per cent were from districts with a high volume of migrant-worker returnees. Calcutta reported 94 new cases, neighbouring Hooghly, North 24-Parganas and Howrah 82, 60 and 56, respectively.
“Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has repeatedly attributed the spike, correctly, to the return of lakhs of migrant workers and others, especially from high-incidence states, over the past few weeks. Many of them have tested positive. It is entirely the responsibility of the Union railway ministry,” said a minister. The total cases on Saturday rose to 7,738, which was 5,130 a week ago and 1,548 a month ago.
“We, however, will do everything possible to take care of our returnee brothers and sisters,” he added.
Bengal now has 11,716 quarantine facilities for returnees on Shramik Special trains, with 1,39,488 people. This is over and above another 1,52,173 in home quarantine and 22,669 in the other 582 state-run quarantine facilities.
“The good news is 2.34 lakh have successfully completed quarantine. Of the 3.14 lakh people in quarantine now, another lakh will have completed it successfully in a week or so,” said the minister.
With the rise in cases, the occupancy in the 8,785 Covid-19 beds — in the 69 dedicated hospitals — also rose to 20.17 per cent, from 13.27 per cent a month ago.
The 9,771 tests reported on Saturday took Bengal’s tests per million count to 2,903. The total number of tests rose to 2,61,288. A month ago, Bengal was recording around 2,600 tests a day. However, the positive confirmation rate rose from 2.64 a week ago to 2.96 per cent now, indicative of higher levels of Covid-19 spread.

Camera detecting body temperature cuts queue at Calcutta airport," Domestic fliers arriving at the Calcutta airport now don’t have to stand in long queues to get their body temperature checked by hand-held devices or fill in a self-declaration form.
Thermal and optical imaging cameras to detect body temperature have been installed near three gates in the arrival area and outside one entrance at the departure level of the airport, officials said.
The camera is grabbing the image of a passenger passing in front of it and the body temperature and thermal image of that person is shown on the monitor placed along with the camera. The doctor sitting in front of the screen can see the thermal image and the body temperature reading of the passenger.

If the image is white, it would mean the person has temperature above normal. He or she will be taken to a hospital for a Covid-19 test or advised quarantine.
Airport officials said the cameras had been installed near gate numbers 3A, 3B and 1B in the arrival section and near gate number 3C in the departure section, airport officials said.
One camera has been installed for international arrival passengers before the immigration clearance.
The state government has installed the cameras and handed over to the airport authorities for maintenance.
Now, 60 domestic flights are arriving in Calcutta every day on an average with 9,000-odd passengers. Airport officials said initially there were long queues of passengers who needed to fill in the self-declaration form and also get their body temperature checked with a hand-held device.
It took about half an hour for a passenger to leave the airport after arrival because of the congestion. Airport officials said it was becoming difficult to ensure social distancing when so many passengers were queuing up.
“We had requested the state government to install thermal cameras which would help ease the congestion. Now, the passengers can just collect luggage from the conveyor belt and walk out of the terminal,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya.
He said one camera was installed in the departure area as a pilot project to see whether it could be used at other gates. During departure, the passengers have to stand in queues to get their baggage sanitised, body temperature checked and then tickets and ID proof checked remotely through a camera.
“We have to see whether installing a camera can actually help reduce queue at the entry gate to the departure area, said Bhattacharya.
Similar cameras have been installed at other airports, including the ones in Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram, officials said.
At the Calcutta airport, arrival passengers no longer have to fill in a self-declaration form. “The passengers are already filling in the form online. Airlines are issuing the form during ticket booking. So, we had requested the state government to do away with the system of filling in the form at the airport after arrival,” director Bhattacharya said.
The new system kicked in on Monday.
“Apart from taking time, multiple touches were involved when a passenger was filling up the form,” he said.",states
Old habits die hard for Meghalaya drug users," Fears of return to drug use and overdose cases among users have been preying on the minds of medical practitioners and activists here following the opening up of activities after a long-drawn lockdown.
The lockdown had reportedly brought about a positive change among drug users here.
“There were many drug users who had turned to opiate substitution therapy and detoxification during the lockdown since the supply was low and the street price of heroin hit the roof,” Meghalaya Users’ Forum president Neil J. Khongwir told The Telegraph.
He said around 550 drug users had taken the therapy from three institutions during the lockdown period. All of these were new to the therapy.
Khongwir said these were also injecting drug users. Heroin is the major drug being used in Meghalaya, and it came at a high price during the lockdown.

Heroin is packed in pieces of paper commonly referred to as puria (packets). The street value of each puria during the lockdown had touched Rs 2,000, he said.
“Many drug users would need around three purias a day. The price was too high for many who could not afford. Even when the price was high, the heroin was not pure. It was adulterated with substances like Rasna powder and Paracetamol tablets in order to increase the quantity,” Khongwir said.
However, with the recent ease in restrictions, the price of each puria had dropped to Rs 1,000, he said. During the pre-lockdown period, the price was not more than Rs 250 to Rs 300 per puria.
Rica Lamar of the Manbha Foundation, which works with drug users, said the fear now is on two counts – drug users returning to their old habits, and cases of overdose.
“I have had many users who came to me for detoxification and medication during the lockdown. There were some who were admitted into rehabilitation centres too. But now, we fear that many of them could return to drug addiction, and we could receive cases of drug overdose,” Lamar, a medical practitioner, said.
To counter drug overdose, she said that the foundation would train their outreach workers and staff to administer Naloxone to those who would need the medication.
Naloxone is commonly used to counter decreased breathing in opioid overdose.
The lockdown had given a chance to many drug users to change, and it was also an opportunity for family members to know and understand what their loved ones who are using drugs were going through, Lamar said.
The Telegraph also caught up with two youths, who are in their twenties, and who had recently gave up drug use to start life afresh.
The youths explained the hazards involved due to drug use, and the significance of will power to change for the better.
“I suffered a lot. It was like hell for me. Each day, I needed heroin packed in one tin of golden tobacco for personal use. Had I been a drug user during the lockdown, I would have faced difficulties. But for the past five months, I had given up, and am on medication,” one of them who had been using drugs for five years said.
Meghalaya police, especially in East Khasi Hills and East Jaintia Hills districts, have been proactive in cracking down drug supply. There have been several seizures of heroin and meth tablets worth crores of rupees.",states
Oil India for blowout death claim probe," Oil India Ltd on Saturday appealed to the Tinsukia administration to probe the reported death of four persons from a nearby village allegedly because of pollution caused by the May 27 oil well blowout.
Oil India has also requested the administration to engage 20 local fishermen to “identify oil spill, if any” in the affected Baghjan area so that immediate action can be taken.
The company took the steps on a day the affected people organised a four-hour dharna from 11am seeking immediate implementation of their demands, including capping of the oil well that is oozing natural gas and condensate, and disbursal of emergency cash relief to tide over their losses.
OIL India had on Friday announced a compensation of Rs 30,000 for each affected family after the district administration submits a list of such people. The decision was taken at a tripartite meeting involving the local deputy commissioner and representatives of the affected people. The list is likely to be ready by Monday.
Earlier, the company had said that based on figures provided by the district authorities, 1,610 families had been evacuated to four relief camps.

A senior Oil India official told The Telegraph that they were having to contend with inclement weather and unsubstantiated reports about death and destruction. It has been raining in the area for the past three days.
“We don’t want to join issue with anyone because it will be our word against theirs. We are focused on capping the gas leak and compensating those who have suffered due to the blowout. We have urged a neutral person (deputy commissioner) to verify the cause of the deaths and also submit the headcount of the affected so that we can extend emergency relief,” the official said.
A situational report issued subsequently by Oil India said gas and condensates continued to flow uncontrollably from the well but that “utmost care has been taken to arrest condensate spillage to surrounding areas” and that a “bund has been created around the well site to prevent the contaminated water runoff to surrounding and nearby water body”.
Oil India also said that “poor” weather was hampering activities related to movement of men and machines and development of an approach road for removing equipment from the site.
The company has engaged local fishermen with boats to identify oil spill, if any, at Maguri Matapung Beel (a lake) so that immediate remedial action can be taken. A Guwahati-based firm has been engaged for bio-remediation of the oil spill, the Oil India statement said.
On moving the district administration for a neutral probe, the statement said the step was taken to ascertain the real cause of the deaths following local media reports “ that four persons have died in Natun Gaon (a nearby village) possibly due to pollution from the blowout”.
Several affected people had told this newspaper that the “condensate” or chemical spray from the blowout had adversely affected nearby water bodies, tea gardens, betel groves, crop fields and livestock, apart from birds, in the eco-sensitive area.
The continuous, ear-splitting noise — like that of an airplane taking off — and the air pollution that caused breathing difficulties have forced the evacuation of the villagers.Oil India has asserted that no human life has been lost due to the release of natural gas, crude oil spillage or condensate because of the company’s operations over the years.
“There are 24/7 paramedical staff at the relief camps and doctors are constantly addressing the health issues of the local people staying in the relief camps or visiting the mobile health camps in the relief camps. As on date, there is no report of any such very serious health issues due to the blowout,” the statement said.
The Oil India official said around 250 of its employees, including those on contract, were working at the site and nobody had complained of any serious health issues except itching in the eyes at the site. He said that at the most, people living within 1.5km of the site would be affected to some extent by the blowout.
Hemanta Moran, who participated in Saturday’s dharna, said nobody had died in Baghjan and that Natun Gaon was about 2.5km from the site of the blowout. “We are also hearing about the deaths and that they had health issues. The overall situation remain unchanged,” he said. He said a dharna would be held every day at the relief camp till their demands were met. ",states
Best of the North East region awaits cinema buffs,"  Some of the best films from the Northeast will be screened during the third edition of Guwahati International Film Festival (GIFF), which starts in the city from October 31.
The seven-day festival, organised by the Assam government-owned Jyoti Chitraban, in association with Dr Bhupen Hazarika Regional Government Film and Television Institute, will be held at the three auditoriums at Srimanta Sankaradeva Kalakshetra and one at Jyoti Chitraban.
Speaking about the films to be screened during GIFF, festival director Monita Borgohain said they have chosen some of the best in the country and abroad, besides films from the Northeast.
“Normally, we can watch films from different countries on various platforms but hardly get to watch our own films. This festival will provide a platform to watch the best contemporary films made in our region. There are some talented filmmakers in the region who have been doing excellent work,” Borgohain told The Telegraph.
Among the films screened will be Rajat Kamal (Silver Lotus) winners like Bulbul Can Sing (Assamese) by Rima Das, In the Land of Poison Women (in Pangchenpa dialect of Arunachal Pradesh) by Manju Borah, Ma’ama (Garo) by Dominic Sangma and Mishing (in Sherdukpan dialect of Arunachal Pradesh) by Bobby Sarma Baruah.
Aamis by Bhaskar Hazarika, which recently won two awards at the third edition of Singapore South Asian International Film Festival, will have its Assam premiere. Jwlwi — The Seed, a Bodo language film by Rajni Basumatary, who played Mary Kom’s mother in her biopic, will also have its world premiere. The film deals with the struggle of families who lost their near and dear ones when insurgency was at its peak in Assam and in other parts of the Northeast. “Besides, we are lucky to have Aribam Syam Sharma’s latest film Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi (The Guest), which will have its world premiere,” Borgohain added.
In the Land of Poison Women is based in Arunachal Pradesh, near the border of China-administered Tibet. It deals with the blind belief in the Pangchenpa community that women have poison in their nails and when they serve food to the males, the latter die immediately or slowly.
Dominic Sangma’s debut feature film Ma’ama narrates the story of Philip Sangma who is searching for his dead wife, Anna.
Mishing deals with the folklore of the Sherdukpen people.",states
Prepaid cabs from LGBI to rest of North East region capitals,"  Prepaid taxi service covering the entire Northeast has been launched from Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International (LGBI) Airport here on Thursday.
The taxi services were inaugurated at the airport by Guwahati (West) MLA Ramendra Narayan Kalita, Airports Authority Of India (AAI) regional executive director Sanjeev Jindal, airport director Ramesh Kumar, and other officials of the state police department.
Addressing the media about the new taxi services in his constituency, Kalita said it was a historic move by the AAI and the police department where a prepaid service for the passengers travelling through Guwahati airport has been launched for the first time in the Northeast.
“The launching of this prepaid taxi service will help boost tourism, provide jobs to local people and benefit passengers coming to Assam and the Northeast as Guwahati is a door for tourism in the state and one should get services right at the airport for all types of conveniences,” he said.
Along with connecting with the capitals of the northeastern states, the prepaid taxi service is also scheduled to cover small distances of upto 0.5km. Airport authorities said the taxi service would also connect Bhutan.
Jindal, while expressing concern for the local taxi drivers and tour operators, said, “Their interests will also be kept in consideration as they are also one of the main stakeholders in operating the cab services for Guwahati airport. It will offer competitive rates and a healthy atmosphere for all taxi drivers with ample space for extending services to other locations. The AAI will also provide basic amenities to taxi operations at the parking area like seating shed, toilets, drinking water and assistance booths.”
“I request the taxi drivers, tour operators and stakeholders concerned to keep the parking area clean. We have witnessed over 27 per cent growth in the passenger movement from this airport and there are lots of opportunities for further growth here,” Kumar said.
“As international flights have started their services from LBGI Airport, more cabs will be added according to the requirement and timing of the flights,” he said.
A pre-paid taxi service booking counter is available at the arrival area of the airport and the taxi can be booked and hired from the city side of the arrival gate, a press release said.",states
Ranchi Municipal Corporation vows to cover 45 open drains," Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) has finally woken up to the urgency of covering as many as 45 open drains across the capital deemed accident-prone zone after Akhil Oraon, a one-and-a-half-year-old boy, fell into one and was washed away some distance before his mother rescued him on Thursday.
Akhil had fallen into an open drain at Pahan Kocha, a part of Friends Colony in Lower Burdwan Compound area under Lalpur police station. His mother spotted him around 15 minutes later, which is why the little boy was spared the fate of Falak, a four-girl-old from Hindpiri who died after getting swept away in an open drain this year in July.
But in those 15 minutes, Akhil had swallowed a lot of dirty water in the drain, and he had to be put under a ventilator at Rani Children Hospital. On Sunday, a hospital source said he was blinking his eyes. Since Akhil belongs to a poor family, Ranchi District Child Welfare Committee has promised to pay the cost of his treatment.
Ranchi municipal commissioner Manoj Kumar held a special meeting on Saturday with senior officials of the engineering section of the RMC and directed them to cover all 45 open drains across the 53 wards of the RMC.
“He directed the engineering section to prepare an estimate within one week for covering the open drains that are causing accidents. Since election is on, no tender can be floated till the model code of conduct is in place. But we will ensure that the moment the election process is over, a tender is floated for this and work to cover drains is done on a priority basis,” said an RMC official.
The official said the drain where Akhil fell was part of the Karam river that merges with the Subernarekha. Guard walls will be built to avoid future accidents here, he said.
Reacting to this incident, JMM candidate Mahua Maji, who is contesting from Ranchi, hit hard at the BJP government and RMC.
“Right from the mayor to the deputy mayor of RMC, the local MLA to the MP, everyone is from the BJP. The BJP is in power in Jharkhand but the party has no time to address basic civic issues. Such incidents (of children and people falling in drains) keep happening in Ranchi but neither the government nor the RMC is ready to learn any lesson,” Maji said.",states
Indian National Congress upbeat in Jamshedpur West," A sense of disappointment among the traditional BJP voters over the party snubbing Saryu Roy and fielding a new face may swing the tide in favour of Congress candidate Banna Gupta in Jamshedpur West Assembly constituency, the grand old party is hoping.
Though the results of the Assembly polls are still two weeks away, poll observers are of the opinion that BJP candidate Devendra Nath Singh might have to bear the brunt of infighting in the party that prompted veteran leader Saryu Roy to cross swords with chief minister Raghubar Das in the Jamshedpur East constituency.
“From the day Roy was denied a party ticket by the BJP, Gupta started mobilising support in his prime vote bank in Zakirnagar, Jawaharnagar and Azadnagar in Mango. He has not only been organising community feasts and litti parties in these densely-populated areas, but also continued to woo voters in Bhatia Bustee and Ulyan in Kadma and slums in Sonari, which are all considered to be BJP’s support base,” said one of Gupta’s campaign managers.
The campaign manager said a major section of Chhattisgarhi population in Sonari (Jamshedpur West), considered to be strong supporters of the BJP, had apparently cast their votes in favour of Congress because they were upset over the ongoing anti-Raghubar Das tirade by Saryu supporters in Jamshedpur East.
In Jamshedpur West, 60 per cent of the total votes polled were from minority-dominated areas such as Zakirnagar, Azadnagar and Jawaharnagar in Mango, which implies that a lesser percentage of votes were polled in areas having traditional BJP supporters.
Gupta, a popular face in BJP-strongholds such as Kadma and Sonari, is learnt to have got considerable votes from these areas as well.
A key BJP functionary said Singh did not get adequate funds from the party for opening offices in a number of places. It also prevented him from spending lavishly on voters. “At most of the polling booths, the BJP cadres were not served breakfast and lunch. As they were all committed BJP supporters, they endured the treatment meted out to them,” the functionary said on the condition of anonymity.
Sudesh Banerjee, a resident of Bhatia Bustee in Kadma, said he had voted for the BJP in the last two elections, but cast his vote in favour of Congress this time. “I did not know much about the BJP candidate this time. Had Roy been been the candidate, things would have been different.”
Singh, however, said the people had voted for me keeping PM Narendra Modi in mind. “My victory is certain.”",states
All Assam Students’ Union members ransack AGP office," Violence marked anti-citizenship bill protests in Dibrugarh on Sunday as hundreds of activists of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) ransacked the district head office of the AGP.
Angry over the pro-bill stand of the AGP, the protesters barged into the party office at Chowkidingee and went on a rampage, breaking chairs, furniture and computers.
The protesters even tore papers and files of the office. The AGP members were caught by surprise in the middle of a meeting. Heckled and confronted, they fled the spot fearing physical assault.
Police teams from Milannagar police outpost and Dibrugarh police station brought the situation under control.
“We were in the middle of a meeting when a large number of protesters barged into our office and vandalised our property. Realising the sentiments of the people against the bill, we have not filed an FIR. However, protests should be done in a democratic manner,” said Taranath Buragohain, the vice-president of the AGP’s Dibrugarh unit.
Dibrugarh superintendent of police Gautam Borah said, “The police have filed an FIR as they (the AGP) have not lodged a complaint yet. Five protesters have been detained. We are examining photographs and videos of the incident and action will be taken.”
Security has been tightened at the local offices of the BJP, AGP and RSS. The residences of the legislators have been secured by the police fearing attacks by activists.
The AGP, an ally of the BJP in the state, had hinted that the party will support the citizenship bill, inviting the wrath of the public.
AGP president Atul Bora who is also the agriculture minister, said the Centre has the requisite number of MPs and if they want to introduce the bill, the AGP cannot do anything. Reiterating that the party will always stand with the people of Assam, the AGP president had noted that it’s time to move on.
In Jorhat, the AJYCP’s Jorhat committee and several other organisations protested against the bill through various programmes on Sunday. The AJYCP took out a bike rally from Jorhat stadium at 11am and students of JB College staged a three-hour hunger strike.
In Udalguri, the family members of the first martyr of the Assam Movement, Khargeswar Talukdar, in the run-up to December 10, observed as Swahid Diwas (Martyrs’ Day), have shown solidarity with the people and lent support to the region-wide movement against the bill. Assam observes the death anniversary of Talukdar, who was killed in police action on December 10, 1979, as Swahid Diwas.
The brother of the martyr, Kameswar Talukdar, said at Uzanbarbari village of Barpeta district, “Our family vehemently opposes the bill and we appeal to the Centre and state government to thwart the implementation of the bill.”
Assistant general secretary of AASU, Jayanta Kumar Bhattacharjya, said, “If the bill becomes an act, the sacrifices made by the 855 martyrs of the Assam Movement will come to nought.”
Altogether 76 martyrs’ families had returned the mementos conferred on them by the state government on Martyrs’ Day in 2016, in protest against the bill when the Centre tried to table it in Parliament in January.

Rebel BJP leader Roy took time off to read media coverage of the ongoing elections.
An early riser, the former food and civil supplies minister took feedback from his poll managers while basking under the sun. “Saryuji subah jaldi uthte hain. Aaj thoda aaram kiye, newspaper padhe aur humse chunav ki batein ki. Khush lag rahe the (Saryuji is an early riser. He took a little rest today, read newspapers and spoke to us about yesterday’s elections),” an aide said.

Care for rare manuscripts," Normal School Silchar under the Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Asian Studies has collected more than 500 very rare and old manuscripts which will be preserved in a special room of the school.
The contents of the manuscripts belong to the times of Ramayan, Mahabharat, Mangalkavya, Purana, and Vaishnavite literature and some even date back to days when sorcery was practised. These will be preserved at the school using modern technology.
Eminent folk culture researcher of south Assam Amalendu Bhattacharjee, played the lead role in collection of these rare manuscripts.
He said collection started in May and those were now ready for preservation.
Bhattacharjee said: “Many years back some teachers of Normal School took the initiative to collect and preserve rare manuscripts of Barak Valley. However, these are now on the verge of extinction due to lack of scientific management. Now with help of the institute these will be preserved properly.”

He said many research works on the manuscripts were done by scholars of the valley and these would be also preserved.
According to him, there will be a list of manuscripts and a researcher can easily get the required information from the list.
Bhattacharjee added that some rare documents were also kept in the record room of the Cachar district administration in Silchar which would also be preserved now.
The chairman of the institute, Sujit Kumar Ghosh, earlier criticised Assam University for not taking initiatives to preserve manuscripts despite having a separate cell in the varsity for that purpose.
Bhattacharjee said they had collected 150 Sanskrit scripts and 362 Bengali scripts.
He said rare manuscripts containing Rajnagar Kavita written by Joy Chandra Bhatta in 1876 was found.
These refer to the devastating earthquake of 1800 Bhattacharjee added they found a part of manuscript of Vishnu Dharmatwa Purana written in Sanskrit in 1688.
He said they also found 80 and 64 scripts of the Ramayan and the Mahabharat respectively, 44 scripts of Mangalkavya, 16 scripts of Purana, 45 scripts of Panchali, 69 scripts of Vaishnava Sahitya, 12 scripts of Gita besides scripts on yoga and sorcery. ",states
War of the ladies in Koderma crying for jobs," Education minister and BJP leader Neera Yadav was called a giant killer when she defeated firebrand four-term MLA and then RJD leader Annapurna Devi from Koderma Assembly seat in 2014.
Come 2019, Neera and Annapurna are in the same party; only Annapurna is now the Koderma MP.
And this time, Neera is facing a tough challenge from friend-turned-foe and former party colleague Shalini Gupta, who has rebelled against the saffron party and hitched her wagon to the Ajsu Party.
Shalini, chairperson of Koderma zilla parishad, is seen as an articulate and feisty mass leader. Neera also faces another challenge in the form of Amitabh Kumar a.k.a. Bablu Choudhary of the RJD, a party that held away in this region for decades.
But the biggest challenge that Neera faces is the allegation that she or her government did not do anything to revive the mica mines in Koderma or set up any factories, spurring a spate of migration among youths and the spectre of joblessness in this once-prosperous belt.
Koderma, better known as mica town, is dominated by vocal Yadav voters. This was why Annapurna’s husband Ramesh Yadav won this seat in 1990 and stayed the MLA till his sudden death in 1998. Riding on sympathy votes, Annapurna represented the Koderma Assembly seat four times as an RJD nominee before her defeat at Neera’s hands in 2014.
No mean feat, as Koderma Lok Sabha seat had been a BJP turf back in the days when the party sent only two seats to Parliament.
In 2014, when the BJP picked up Neera to contest against a veteran leader like Annapurna in 2014, the decision surprised many. But Neera proved herself more than equal to the job. After winning the election, she was also rewarded with the important education portfolio.
However, on home turf, opponents kept targeting Neera for ignoring local issues and staying away from people, something the lawmaker vehemently denies.
Party colleague Shalini, known to be a firebrand orator, was known to have angled for the Koderma ticket. But when Neera got the ticket, a miffed Shalini joined the Ajsu, and did not mince words while talking about her former colleague. “What development? She only thought about her self-development,” Shalini frequently says.
RJD’s Amitabh Kumar a.k.a. Bablu Choudhary also says nothing has changed in the past five years. “People want change,” he says.
A botany professor from Jhumri Tilaiya, Asha Sahay, agreed. “Roads are bad, there are no jobs, I feel bad for youngsters who have nothing to look forward to here,” she said.

"Knife killed man, not bullet: Jharkhand police"," A new twist has emerged in the police firing case at Baghni village in Sisai Assembly, Speaker Dinesh Oraon’s seat in Gumla district where Jilani Ansari, 28, died during poll violence on voting day, Saturday.
Jharkhand Police, in a news release on Sunday evening, stated Jilani died of wounds from a sharp object and not a bullet.
It was earlier said that Ansari died due to a bullet after cops of Rapid Action Force (RAF) opened fire in self-defence on a mob that pelted stones at the police and tried to snatch their weapons.
A highly placed police officer in Gumla, who did not want to come on record, explained to The Telegraph that the wound on Jilani’s body was “not clean like the one made by a bullet”. “It looks like Jilani died of stab wounds made from a long knife and not a bullet,” he said.
He added that the post-mortem would be released on Monday. “But the doctors have drawn their conclusions from the jagged nature of the wounds on his stomach,” the police officer stressed. “In fact, a part of the intestine has come out. It is a messy wound.”
A team of three doctors headed by Dr Sunil Kisku of Gumla Sadar hospital conducted the post-mortem on Jilani’s body on Saturday after which it was handed over to the family. The policeman added that the victim was likely to have been stabbed by someone in the crowd.
Tension erupted on Saturday morning following altercation between two warring groups at booth 36 of the seat where polling was underway. Voters and supporters of various political parties had started creating a ruckus when the police intervened to pacify them and warned them to not to disturb polling. The mob attacked the police with stones, some people tried to snatch weapons, police said, justifying why the forces opened fire. In the clash, another youth Ashfaq Ansari suffered a bullet injury on his leg.
The Election Commission of India has ordered re-polling at booth 36 where polling was suspended following the violent clash.
The re-polling at the booth located at Urdu Upgraded Middle School at Baghni village in Sisai will now be held between 7am and 3 pm on Monday.
Gumla SP Anjani Kumar Jha said two FIRs had been lodged. “The first was filed by the booth’s presiding officer against unidentified persons for disturbing the poll process and attacking the polling party and security forces under Section 307 and other relevant sections of IPC. The second FIR was lodged by Roshni Khatoon; wife of the deceased Jilani against RAF cops,” said Jha.",states
"17-year-old burnt to death in Tripura over dowry, Court sent fiance and his mother to 14 days JC"," A local Court of Belonia sub-division of Tripura’s North District on Sunday sent a mother and her son to 14 days Judicial Custody for allegedly burning alive a 17-year-old girl after her family failed to meet the financial demands of her fiancé and his mother in Santirbazar of North Tripura district, around 83 km from here.
Speaking to The Telegraph on Sunday the Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) of Santirbazar, Pranab Debnath said Ajoy Rudra Paul (23) the accused who is a plumber had a love affair with the 17 years old girl for last two years and eloped with her on October 28 last from her house at Kalyanpur in Khowai district, around 125 Km from here.
“The deceased used to stay at Ajay’s home after they eloped. However, both the family had agreed to formalize their marriage on Dec 11. As per FIR lodged by the deceased family they alleged that Ajay and his mother Anima Rudra Paul has asked for dowry money of Rs Rs.50 thousand and the family of the deceased could hardly manage Rs.15, 000. On December 06 last Ajay and his mother reportedly took the money from the deceased family and the same day, he accompanied by his mother allegedly set her on fire. She was rushed to G B Panth hospital where she succumbed to her burn injuries”, he said.
He also said that Ajay’s one relative got married to the girl’s family and that’s how they first knew each other. Later, they started talking over the phone and social media.
The SDPO has cleared that some rumors of gang rape spread across social media which is absolutely fake.
“On Saturday the deceased died at the hospital. We have arrested both the mother and his son and produced them before the court which has sent them to 14 days Judicial Custody. Some rumors of gang rape have also spread across social media which is totally fake. We are investigating the matter”, the SDPO told The Telegraph.
Speaking to reports on Saturday, Sabita Choudhury the mother of the deceased said, “I have two daughters and she was my elder daughter. She was 17 years old. My daughter Supriya Choudhury eloped with Ajoy Rudra Paul. We even agreed to arrange a social marriage but they were asking for a dowry of Rs. 50 thousand and other home accessories. Then we said we can give only Rs 25 thousand and later we have sent Rs. 15 thousand to them. On Friday around 4 pm she called me but her fiancé did not allow her to talk with me but at around 5 Pm Ajay called me and said that she committed suicide by setting fire on herself”.
She also alleged that Ajay and her mother set fire on Supriya because they could not pay the money.

"Calcutta Metro gives Rs 25,000 as ex gratia to 5 with fractures"," Five passengers who suffered fractures in the melee resulting from the Metro fire on Thursday got Rs 25,000 each on Tuesday in what a railway official described as a “much-needed gesture”.
The five passengers received calls from the office of the chief operations manager before Metro officials visited their homes to hand over the cash.
The callers apologised for the trouble caused to the passengers and promised all possible help in their rehabilitation.
The Metro authorities had come in for a lot of flak for not apologising to the passengers and for not coming out with an offer of compensation.
“The money given on Tuesday was ex gratia, not compensation,” chief operations manager Satyaki Nath said. “It was a much-needed gesture.”
Oxford Learner’s Dictionary defines ex gratia as “given or done as a gift or favour, not because there is a legal duty to do it”.
Nath said handing out ex gratia payments was the norm after railway accidents.
Manoj Bhagat, one of those who received the payment, welcomed the move but expressed the hope that it was the beginning and not the end.
The 27-year-old fractured both his legs after he jumped out through a window of the second coach of the Dum Dum-bound train that caught fire minutes after it had pulled out of Rabindra Sadan station.
Several passengers jumped out of the train after smashing windowpanes to escape the smoke that filled up multiple compartments.
Bhagat, who works at a chartered accountancy firm and freelances as a tax consultant, has been advised “bed rest” for at least five months.
“I am almost out of work. I need compensation,” he told the Metro official who had come calling at his sister’s home in Howrah’s Ramrajatala with the money.
“My elder brother is epileptic and has other medical conditions. My mother would not have been able to take care of both of us together. That is why my sister brought me here.”
Bhagat’s sister told the official that his brother, who has both his legs in cast, could not even go to the bathroom on his own.
The official told the family that he was not authorised to speak on compensation but advised Bhagat to file the documents related to his treatment.
“A list of 12 passengers has been drawn up under the supervision of the chief medical officer. Five of them who suffered grievous injuries are entitled to Rs 25,000 each. Those with simple injuries are entitled to Rs 5,000 each,” Metro spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said.
Three of the seven passengers who suffered “simple injuries” were handed Rs 5,000 each during the day. “The other passengers are out of station. They will receive the payment once they are back,” said Banerjee.",states
Calcutta cops seize 200 bikes for rule flout on 31st night," Riding without helmets, rash driving and other violation of road rules resulted in seizure of over 200 motorcycles from Park Street and adjacent roads on New Year’s Eve.
In previous years, riders were allowed to walk away with their two-wheelers after they were made to pay a fine or their licences were seized.
This New Year’s Eve, police in the Park Street area seized the vehicles to deny them an opportunity to repeat the offence while the revelry was still on.
People whose two-wheelers were seized lined up under the Park Street flyover on Tuesday morning to pay the fine and claim their vehicles.
Many of those whose bikes were seized were repeat-offenders and had multiple cases of traffic rule violation pending against them. Officers of the South Traffic Guard told them they would get their vehicles back only after clearing their dues.
A number of “repeat offenders” had to cough up thousands of rupees before they were handed the keys to their vehicles.
A senior officer said this was the first time such a drive had been undertaken against “unruly bikers” on a festive occasion.
“The idea was to set an example. We have seen that bikers, once prosecuted on a festive day, tend to assume that they would not be prosecuted for the same offence again the same day. Hence, they keep violating rules. So, this year we decided to seize bikes,” a senior officer at Lalbazar said.
Usually, the maximum number of traffic rule violations are reported from Park Street, Park Circus, Camac Street, AJC Bose Road flyover and the Parama flyover. The majority of offenders has always been bikers.
“The drive against errant bikers was launched in certain pockets of south Calcutta where people gather to party in large number on occasions such as New Year’s Eve and where violation of traffic rules, often under the influence of alcohol, is rampant,” an officer said.
A section of officers pointed out that booking revellers for violating traffic rules without marring the festive spirit was difficult.
“During festivals it is important to profile the people at fault. People should not feel harassed. For example, bikers without helmets but travelling with family were let off with a warning. But youths speeding without helmets were intercepted and their vehicles seized.
“There were instances of errant bikers escaping cops at one signal but getting caught at the next,” an officer in south Calcutta said.
Police sources said news of two-wheelers being seized on and around Park Street spread by word of mouth, making others cautious.
“We are sure that if we had intercepted 200 bikers and seized their vehicles, the news must have stopped another 100 from breaking the law,” the officer added.
The seized two-wheelers were kept on the ground floor of Chatterjee International Centre, from where their owners could collect them after paying the fine at the South Traffic Guard office under the Park Street flyover.",states
BJP to form Jharkhand government with absolute majority: Rudy," Asserting that the BJP would win with an absolute majority in Jharkhand, the party's national spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said people would cast votes in favour of 'good governance and political stability'.
He insisted that the double-engine government of the BJP at the Centre and the state would ensure an all-round development of Jharkhand.
'The BJP has a long-term vision for the development of the state. If the governments at the Centre and the state are the same then development becomes easier,' Rudy told reporters here on Saturday.
Listing the achievements of the Raghubar Das government, he said the saffron party has worked for tribal welfare, infrastructure development and agricultural growth over the past five years.
'I, too, had voted in favour of Jharkhand's statehood when the proposal was placed (in Parliament). But the irony was that after its creation, there was no political stability for several years. The state saw a person without any ideology or party becoming the chief minister,' Rudy said, referring to former Independent MLA Madhu Koda's tenure from 2006 to 2008.
The BJP, however, has given a stable government to Jharkhand over the last five years, the BJP MP said.
'This time, too, people will vote for stability and good governance. The BJP will form a government in Jharkhand with absolute majority,' he stated.
The senior BJP leader said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had always taken a 'keen interest' in the development of the state.
'The decisions taken by Modi and his government has always has had a positive effect on the states and the country as a whole -- be it abrogation of Article 370 or ban on triple talaq,' he said.
Taking a dig at the Opposition alliance of the JMM, the Congress and the RJD, he said, 'Parties functioning around their families can never work for the state's growth.'
He said that Raghubar Das during the second of the five-phase assembly elections, would win with a comfortable margin from Jamshedpur (East).
'Unlike other political parties, the BJP runs on principals and policies,' he added.
A five-phase election to the 81 Assembly constituencies began in Jharkhand on November 30. Voting will conclude on December 20 and counting will be held three days later, on December 23.",states
Women police on night raid in Calcutta," An all-woman team of Calcutta police on Friday night arrested 13 men for harassing and behaving inappropriately with women on the roads across south Calcutta.
A team of officers of the anti-rowdy squad of the detective department assisted the women’s team named “The Winners”.
“A woman best understands the plight of another woman. The Winners usually maintain vigil in areas that have women’s colleges and girls’ schools. With the women force on the vigil, such places have become safer for other women,” said an officer of the detective department.
Officers of the all-woman team have been trained in self-defence to counter any adverse situation and capture mischief-makers on roads.
The team raided areas in Netaji Nagar on Friday night and detained 60 people.
“Thirteen out of the 60 detained were arrested for harassing women. The team also seized 51 motorcycles for rogue and reckless driving,” said an officer.
Several women commuters said they felt less vulnerable if women officers were around.
“It is expected that they will be more sensitive towards women’s issues than men. If someone is harassed in an auto, the victim does not have to explain this to the officer how it feels if the officer is a woman herself,” said a college student who lives in Garia and has to commute in public transport every day.
All members of The Winner have been given a scooter each to make them mobile on the roads.

“We sat inside our car for one hour because of the traffic snarl. When we reached Bogibeel we could not find a place because a huge crowd had gathered there for a New Year’s feast,” said Rupjyoti Khound, a resident of Dibrugarh.
The Dibrugarh and Dhemaji district administrations in Upper Assam have issued directives for streamlining traffic on Bogibeel bridge.
On Saturday, the Dibrugarh administration issued a directive requesting police to immediately deploy personnel and adequate force for traffic management on the bridge.
The Dhemaji administration also issued an order on Saturday, prohibiting drivers of vehicles from stopping for more than three minutes on the bridge and warned of action if the rule was not followed. “Traffic management has become a huge challenge after the opening of Bogibeel bridge because vehicles are coming continuously from both the sides. Some of them parked their vehicles in the middle of the bridge to take photos. Our department is working day and night to streamline traffic on the bridge,” said a traffic official.
Bogibeel bridge is the longest rail-cum-road bridge spanning 4.94km which connects Dibrugarh and Dhemaji districts of Upper Assam.
“We have come to see Bogibeel bridge but we had to face a traffic snarl and waited for two hours to get to the bridge. After two hours we finally crossed the bridge to the Dhemaji side,” said Anjali Bhattacharjee, a resident of Tinsukia.
Accidents have occurred on Bogibeel bridge owing to lack of traffic management.
A seven-year-old boy was killed and another was injured on Thursday in two separate accidents on the bridge and its approach road.
John Pame, 7, died after being hit by a vehicle on the approach road at Kulajan in Dhemaji.
In another incident on the same day, Saurav Moran, 7, was critically injured after being hit by a car and admitted to a private nursing home in Dibrugarh.",states
Heritage honour for eateries," Calcuttans have always put a lot of thought to the food on their plates. To honour the foodie in every Calcuttan and map the culinary heritage of the city, Intach in association with The Telegraph presented the Calcutta Culinary Heritage Awards, 2019, to 14 eateries that have made a name in the heart of citizens.
The awardees were given certificates and will be at a later date presented with a blue plaque in line with the blue plaque scheme in London to recognise their heritage status.
A panel of three had shortlisted about a hundred names initially. “There were around a 100 names categorised into different cuisines they served. The criteria for selection was that they had to be within the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area, has been in business since 1960 or earlier, is still in operation or alive in public memory and has a historical or cultural significance,” says Ayan Ghosh, an Intach member.
“We approached the establishments and asked for some document regarding their inception. It could be a corporation certificate or a licence or a lease agreement,” said Ghosh.
They referred to the Calcutta Street Directory brought out by Thacker, Spink & Company to establish the authentic dates and streets where the eateries were located. A lot of unknown facts came to the fore while mapping this intangible heritage of the city. Like Trinca’s and Flury’s operated from the same premises at one time. Or that Kwality restaurant on Park Street first started as a tea room, serving snacks, said PN Ghai, who was there at the Fairlawn Hotel to receive the certificate.
“Kwality was started by my uncle. We used to serve snacks and then we served ice creams made in the kitchen. My family had learnt to make ice creams from Americans in Delhi,” said Ghai.
Bhim Nag, Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy, the custodians of Calcutta’s sweetmeat heritage, do not believe in having branches or expanding geographically. “Its difficult to maintain quality,” said Prajesh Nandy, of Nakur of 1844 vintage.
“This recognition will go a long way in establishing the culinary heritage in the city,” he said.
The Nakur shop on Ramdulal Sarkar Street has retained its vintage look with its red oxide floor where mounds of fresh chena on large wooden plates are rubbed vigorously by the moiras (sweetmakers). Kodapaker monda is the oldest sweetmeat from which other sweets have evolved, said Nandy.
Another restaurateur, who is a stickler for quality is Joel Huang of Eau Chew. “I buy all the ingredients myself and cook too,” said Huang, whose great grandmother started the establishment in 1927.
The list of 14 eateries will not be the only ones to get the blue enamel plaques, which are a heritage product itself. “There will be future editions to the Calcutta Heritage Culinary Awards and more establishments will get added on,” said G.M. Kapur of Intach. ",states
Fall to death from flyover," A two-wheeler rider in his 30s died after falling from Parama flyover on Saturday evening.
Kamalesh Singh, a resident of Karl Marx Sarani, was speeding and fell from the flyover, cops said. He landed near Topsia police station, not far from the Park Circus seven-point crossing.
He was taken to the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. Police are yet to ascertain if he was wearing a helmet.
The two-wheeler was seized for mechanical testing.
In July, a scooter-borne delivery boy for an online food delivery portal died in an accident on the Parama flyover when he and his friend had sneaked into the overbridge by dodging guardrails. Neither had been wearing a helmet.
Sanjay Rana, 23, a resident of Pulin Khatick Road in Tangra and his friend Chottu Das, 20, also from the same neighbourhood, were returning home when they broke through the police cordon and sped along the EM Bypass-bound flank of the Parama flyover.
The two-wheeler, which belonged to Rana, apparently skidded throwing the duo to the ground on the flyover stretch above Boat Club.
Rana had died at the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.
Das, who was riding pillion, had also received serious head injuries.",states
Model booths with festive feel in Jharkhand," Balloons and voting? Why not.
The second phase of Jharkhand’s Great EVM Festival attracted many voters to 129 model booths in East Singhbhum district.
Voters, young and old, loved the balloon-and-flower decorations and Selfie Corners at the model booths.
Md Jawaid, a civil engineer with Dalmia Cement who voted in Rajendra Vidyalaya, Sakchi, under the Jamshedpur West seat, said the model booth “made the voting exercise a joyful festival”.
“It was so well decked up,” said Jawaid. “All around me, I saw positive vibes. Normally, a polling booth is rather boring. The model booth was festive and made one feel proud to participate in the great democratic process. Everyone loved the Selfie Corner.”
But if he had a quibble, it was with the drinking water facility at the model booth.
“I could not have water at the booth because there were no glasses or paper cups near the three water jars,” he said. “But the rest of the arrangements were fine,” he added.
At nearby Rabindra Bhavan, also a model booth, elderly voters appreciated the chairs that they could sit on after they voted. “Model booths are a nice concept, best part is you can click good pictures that are ideal for social media. These arrangements motivate a voter,” said Sreejani Das who voted at Rabindra Bhavan.
But there were a few snags. At the model booth at Vivekananda International School, Mango, voting was late by 90 minutes as the EVM acted up.
Apart from 129 model booths, the district also had 25 booths where all poll officers were women.",states
Lowest turnout in Jamshedpur West," Voting day for Jamshedpur West, one of the best-known seats among the 20 in the second phase of state elections, ended on a grim note, as only 47.42 per cent — less than half the 3.2 lakh voters — had inked their fingers — the lowest on Saturday.
Jamshedpur West, including urban areas Bistupur, Sakchi, Sonari and Mango, hit the headlines this time when veteran BJP MLA and minister Saryu Roy was denied a ticket from the party to make way for newbie Devendra Nath Singh. A humiliated Roy went on to challenge CM Raghubar Das, five-time BJP MLA from Jamshedpur East, leaving West a more or less a straight fight between BJP’s Singh and Congress’s former MLA-minister Banna Gupta.
With Roy out, many in Congressman Gupta’s camp hoped hardcore Roy loyalists would shift allegiance to him. The Singh camp, on its part, hoped that party loyalists would not be swayed by the personality cult. The mystery will be unveiled only on December 23, counting day.
Polling in Jamshedpur West was slow from 7am and 9am when 13.3 per cent votes were cast. By 11am, the polling had risen to 20.3 per cent and by 3pm, to 43.22 per cent. At localities like Zakirnagar, Azadnagar and Jawaharnagar in Mango with over one lakh voters from the minority community, the voting per cent stood at 46 by 3pm, with two more hours of voting left. By 5pm, the figure rose marginally to 47.42 per cent.
At Zakirnagar in Mango, octogenarian Amrul Nisha turned up to cast her vote in a wheelchair. Another octogenarian, Sahnawaz Bano, who could barely walk, came to vote at a polling booth in Azadnagar.
“Many of our young voters are working in the Gulf. If the elderly don’t vote, how can we ensure the victory of the Congress candidate?” quipped a party worker.
At traditional BJP strongholds such as Bhatia Bustee, Uliyan, Shastrinagar, Khuntadih, Gwala Bustee, Adarshnagar in Sonari, people crowded the polling booths.
At posh Bistupur, with some pockets having a distinct tilt toward the saffron party, very few young voters were seen, most studying or working outside Jamshedpur.
“There are nine voters in my family, but only four of us could vote today (Saturday),” said J. Katina, a Bistupur resident, adding the rest were scattered in Bangalore and other cities.
Jamshedpur West has 3.2 lakh voters, including 1.2 lakh from the minority community.",states
Revellers throng Dhanbad butterfly park," The Sir Dorabji Tata Park at Jamadoba here was swarming with butterflies to welcome hundreds of picnickers who flocked to the greens from all across coal town and beyond to celebrate the New Year.
The 10,820sqm park, which generally remains open for visitors between 4pm and 6pm every Sunday, was closed for maintenance for the last two weeks. It was opened from 9am to 5pm on Tuesday as a special case.
The environment department of Tata Steel, which maintains the park, had planted at least 15 different varieties of flowering plants including dahlia, pansy, petunia, marigold, calendula and chrysanthemum in the 1,385sqm butterfly zone to attract more than 20 species of the winged guests.
Some of the butterfly species which were seen hovering in the park included the bright orange Baronet, the brownish Common Baron, the multi-coloured Common Jezebel, the velvet brown Dark Branded Bushbrown, the large-winged Tailed Jay and the long-tailed Paris Peacock.
The butterfly zone, which was created last year near the mango orchard, has 1,687 varieties of plants to attract the flying insects.
Tata Steel and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) had conducted a joint survey of the area in 2015-16 and identified around 20 butterfly species in the area.
Based on the report, Tata Steel had decided to create a special butterfly zone to conserve the biodiversity and also to save the species from becoming endangered.
“After some initial work like ground levelling, intensive plantation began in 2015 during which altogether 1,047 plants, including host plants (used for breeding butterflies) and nectar yielding varieties were planted,” said Ankit Agrahari, senior manager (environment) of Tata Steel Jharia division.

Temple tourist with Kali at heart," Salt Lake recently had a visitor from the US who went — not shopping or sight-seeing but — visiting as many temples as she could.
Deonnie Moodie is a pass-out from Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with a PhD in the Study of Religion. Now an assistant professor of South Asian religions at the University of Oklahama, Deonnie has spent years studying the Kalighat temple and has written the book The Making of a Modern Temple and a Hindu City.
The Telegraph Salt Lake spoke to Deonnie when she had come to visit temples in Salt Lake.

What got you interested in this topic?
Well, I first came to India in 2002 while pursuing an under graduate course on religions of India. I travelled to 11 cities, including Calcutta, where I visited Dakshineshwar and Kalighat.
Eventually I specialised in religions of urban India and religions in modernity, mainly in Calcutta. I lived in Tollygunge for a year and learnt to speak and read Bengali too.
Why Calcutta and why Kali?
When the Europeans wrote the history of Calcutta they began with the arrival of Job Charnock in the 1600s. They made it seem like there was nothing but marshes here before that and it is they who built the city. But later when Bengalis started writing history they said it’s not a city of Charnock but Kali and Kalighat.
Kali is Ma. She gives, she takes away…I’ve seen people keep her picture behind their phones and turn to it in times of trouble. But for me the most interesting was how the Kalighat temple has been central to creating an Indian and Bengali modernity. Kali doesn’t become irrelevant when people become modern. In fact, she stays central to the modernising efforts.
How is that?
When Kalighat became a public temple in the 20th century, the upper-middle class came out and voiced complaints. They complained about misappropriation of funds received as donations, greedy pandas (touts), dishonest sevaits, about the temple being dirty, disorganised…. They talked about it, wrote about it to newspapers and even lodged public interest litigations.
But have the court rulings brought about real change?
The court can pass a ruling but if a chunk of devotees, pandas and sevaits oppose it, what can be done?
CCTVs have been installed to keep an eye on things but as for matters like cleanliness, it boils down to what you classify as dirt. The court may say petals and blood on the floor are dirt but blood is part of what the temple is; Kali receives blood as sacrifice.
Devotees run to smear the spilt blood on their heads as tika or take it home in jars to ward off evil. What is dirt to one is sacred to another.
The beggars who live on the temple grounds are opposed to renovation as they will have nowhere to go. There’s also a school that believes that Kali gave the sevaits the right and responsibility to worship her and so who is anyone else to say they’re doing it wrong?
Is religion important to urban Indians today?
Well, many may not go to Kalighat anymore citing the dirt and harassment but they still ask their domestic helps to go make a sacrifice on their behalf.
People create the temples they need. My landlord, for instance, had a thakur ghor inside his cupboard!
This is what I want to focus on next — home shrines. Community is a big part of religion so people still go to temples but home shrines are increasingly getting important.
I’ve studied Bengalis in the US too and while they celebrate Durga, Kali or Saraswati puja, temples are not that important to them. Most temples in the US have pictures of many gods but the temples themselves are built by south Indians, with typical southern architecture.
What brought you to Salt Lake?
Well, I want to study how religion is practised in suburbs like this one. I mean Salt Lake is a planned township with space earmarked right from the start for parks, markets and hospitals but why not for temples?
I agree Salt Lake was planned by a Yugoslav architect-planner (Dobrivoje Toskovic) but he did it in consultation with BC Roy and other Indians so why this glaring omission?
But like I said, people create the temples they need…under trees, outside their complexes…. (On this trip Deonnie visited a Shani temple under a tree outside GD Market, the EC Block Kali temple, the CRPF Camp Shiva temple and Loknath temple outside the stadium).
How religious are people in the US?
Well, just like in India, some Americans are religious, some are not. On Sunday mornings gyms and libraries are more likely to be crowded than churches. But people think of god as a source of strength.
My students are interested in religion. Most have never met a Hindu, Muslim, Jain or Sikh before. They may have stereotypes in their minds and are not comfortable discussing them with their families. They come to my class to gain exposure.
And which god do you pray to?
I am culturally a Christian, married to a Jew. My job is not to give verdict on which religion is right and wrong. I don’t judge, I just want to know what you believe.
My husband and I are raising our son to be curious about religion. We’re telling him we don’t know what happens after death and so we have to focus on our actions now as what we do affects one other. ",states
Jorhat auction goes live on Tea Day," Jorhat tea auction centre will go live on International Tea Day (May 21) with more emphasis on quality.
Jorhat is Assam’s second tea auction centre after Guwahati.
The Jorhat e-Auction Platform will be run by mjunction in association with Tea Board India. The company, mjunction services limited, is a 50:50 venture promoted by SAIL and Tata Steel.
The auction will be held on May 21 from 11am. Sellers shall upload and submit Garden Invoices (GI) on the Jorhat platform latest by Tuesday at 11am. Sellers shall login to MJ (mjunction) platform with their usernames and passwords and upload the tea details to be put up for auction.
The minimum lot size per invoice, to be packed by sellers, shall be 5 packages.
The auction will be conducted once every week- every Monday.
Depending on volume and process improvement, it may be scheduled twice a week later.“With the auction platform, a new service has been planned in unprecedented times, in the middle of a pandemic with little change from the original model which shows the aspirations of the industry to meet uncertainties,” the official said, adding that many of the unique services have been given a final shape by mjunction by drawing upon its experience across a wide array of commodities.
The official said one of the novelties of the Jorhat e-Auction Platform would be quality vocabulary through which teas will be judged.
“A detailed quality vocabulary shall be provided to help buyers objectively arrive on quality. Specific comments shall be given on leaf appearance, infusion and liquor. There shall be further sub-parameters under each of the broad heads. A rating system from 1 to 10 shall be followed with 1 being low in quality and 10 being excellent,” the official said. At present, teas are valued based on physical appearance, which is done by brokers. “Sample distribution will start after normalcy but quality vocabulary would be available both then and now,” the official added.
“This will be a historic event for various reasons. The longstanding demand of the stakeholders for a separate auction platform in Assam is over. This step will help accommodate the larger volume of Assam tea which contributes more than 50 per cent of the country’s production.”
A weekly auction cycle shall be followed instead of the four weeks earlier. On the mjunction platform, all important activities like catalogue closing, auction day and buyers’ prompt day shall be carried out on a Monday.
“We are overwhelmed with the response of tea industry to the Jorhat e-marketplace. We are confident that with the support of the tea community, the tea e-marketplace would usher in increased reach, efficiency, and shorter cycle time for the good of the entire tea community,” said Vinaya Varma, managing director of mjunction.
The Guwahati Tea Auction Buyers Association says it will give a new experience to its members.",states

Rajeev Kumar gets bail from Calcutta High Court," Former Calcutta police chief Rajeev Kumar, allegedly absconding after apprehending arrest by the CBI in the Saradha probe, got a breather on Tuesday after a Calcutta High Court division bench granted him anticipatory bail.
Soon after, CBI sources said they had started the process for challenging the verdict in the Supreme Court.
Accepting the bail plea of the IPS officer, the division bench of Justices Sahidullah Munshi and Subhasish Dasgupta held that at this stage of the Saradha probe, there is no need for the CBI to seek Kumar’s custodial interrogation.
The bench also said Kumar had co-operated with the CBI and appeared before the agency whenever called. The court, however, asked Kumar to obtain a formal bail from any subordinate court by furnishing two personal release bonds of Rs 50,000 each.
The court directed Kumar to appear before the CBI investigators and co-operate with them. “The CBI will have to issue a 48-hour prior notice to the petitioner (Kumar) asking him to appear before it,” the bench said.

To secure bail, Kumar had moved every level of the judiciary since April this year, after the Supreme Court withdrew his protection and gave him the liberty to seek anticipatory bail before any court in Bengal.
As the CBI had issued a notice to Kumar in May this year to appear, the IPS officer first moved Calcutta High Court seeking quashing of the notice. The court then issued an interim order restraining the CBI from taking any coercive measures against Kumar till his petition was disposed of.
On September 3, a single-judge bench of Justice Madhu Mitra dismissed Kumar plea, holding that the CBI had the power to interrogate Kumar.
Armed with the order, the CBI officers went to Kumar’s residence at Park Street that very day to hand him a notice asking him to appear for interrogation the next day. But Kumar was not available at his residence. Since then, the investigators have raided various places in the state but failed to trace him.
Kumar had first moved an anticipatory before a Barasat judge. He failed to obtain an order and then moved the district and sessions judge of Alipore. But the Alipore judge, too, declined to grant him bail. Kumar then moved the division bench of the high court.
According to CBI, as a member of the special investigation team formed by the Mamata Banerjee government to probe the Saradha scam, Kumar had damaged certain documents which he did not hand over to the agency after the Supreme Court entrusted it with the probe. ",states
Assam govt mulls solution for lockdown 4 immobility," A fresh problem has arisen before the state government — to address the troubles of the section of people who are unable to run their business during lockdown 4.0.
Business in the city edged towards normalcy on the first day of the fourth phase of the lockdown with relaxations allowing shops to open, barring shopping malls, salons, gymnasiums and parlours.
The government has not allowed these places to function yet.
On Monday, the Guwahati development department asked the Kamrup (metro) district administration to prepare a road map urgently to deal with the situation while continuing to fight Covid-19, the move coming 54 days after the lockdown began on March 24 midnight.
GDD minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya, after a discussion with the district authority, said, “A new problem has arisen. A large number of people who work in shopping malls, gymnasiums or run salons and beauty parlours continue to suffer because of the lockdown. Therefore, I have asked the district authority and the labour department to come up with a roadmap for the next three months to provide relief to these people. They are in deep trouble.”
He said immediate and innovative steps were required to address the situation.
Earlier, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, citing a survey by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), had said that Assam was losing around Rs 1,000 crore daily because of the Covid-19-induced lockdown.
To those who have opened shops, city police issued a warning — adhere to the norms of social distancing and face cover or lose trade licence.
The authortities fear a possible rush in the market in view of Id celebrations and lockdown 4.0 relaxations.
Guwahati police commissioner M.P. Gupta said, “Since the lockdown has been eased for public utility, we urge the public to strictly adhere to the norm of social distancing. We have also decided to impose a fine of Rs 500 for not wearing face masks.”
On Monday, the top brass of the state police visited the containment zone of Fancy Bazar, the business hub of the Northeast which continues to remain closed, to assess the situation.
The traders in the area believe that it will be safe to reopen business only after the swab test results of the workers in the area are out.
A shopkeeper said, “Some of the traders wanted to open their shops today following lockdown 4.0 relaxations but we decided not to till the reports come clean.”
The health department has tested hundreds of workers from the area after about 20 people, contacts of the market’s first patient, were found to be positive.
The state Covid count was 106 till the filing of this report with at least 31 cases from the city.
Many traders also requested the Kamrup (metro) district administration to take immediate steps in terms of perishable food stocks lying unattended due to the containment zone restrictions in the area.
The metro administration declared Haryana Bhawan near Bharalumukh as a containment zone on Monday, following the detection of one positive case from a quarantine centre there. The city now has a dozen containment zones. The administration also withdrew its order of closure of Allahabad Bank, Machkhowa branch, here after the bank officials tested negative on Monday.

Tarun Parui, a businessman from Howrah, bought a 1.25kg hilsa from Maniktala on Thursday evening. “I was in two minds over hilsa and mutton. But when the fish seller said the hilsa was from Bangladesh, it was a no-brainer,” said Parui, who will host his brother-in-law for lunch on Friday.
“I get treated to a lavish feast on Jamai Sashthi at my in-laws’ place every year. Bhai Phonta is when I get to play host and I don’t want a loss of face,” said Parui, a regular at Maniktala. He also bought lobsters for Rs 600 a kilo.
Bacchu Pramanik, a fish seller at Maniktala, said apart from hilsa and prawn, topshe, parshe and pomfret were the hot selling items.
Pratima Roy bought topshe and parshe from Gariahat, for Rs 750 and Rs 500 a kilo respectively. Also on her shopping list was mutton. “I like to cook for my brothers on Bhai Phonta,” said Roy, 49, a Bengali teacher at a government school.
A group of three sisters came looking for katla, lobsters, pabda and topshe at the Gariahat market on Thursday morning. “We have a grand family feast on Bhai Phonta every year. We have two cousins who come with their families,” said Tulika Bandopadhyaya, 40, the elder sister.",states
Consult specialist doctors for free in Jharkhand," Patients locked down in their houses can now consult specialist doctors for free on esanjeevaniopd.in, the telemedicine portal of the National Health Mission.

“We have given different specialists separate dates for convenience of patients during the one-hour period. While general medicine specialists will be available on Monday, orthopaedic and child specialists will be available on Tuesday, surgery specialists will be available on Wednesday, eye and gynaecology specialists on Thursday, ENT (ear, nose and throat) and dentists on Friday and skin specialists on Saturday,” said Pathak.
In view of the large number of migrant workers returning to the state, most of them without work and under mental trauma, the health department also has psychiatrist consultation daily for an hour.
“We have three psychiatrists from the state health department and one from RIMS who will be offering their services on the telemedicine portal depending on the roster throughout the week for one hour between 1pm and 2pm. It is needed because during the lockdown there have been cases of people suffering from depression and with a large number of migrant workers returning after leaving their jobs and earning under mental trauma, such counselling will help them turn a new leaf,” said Pathak.
This would be in addition to the counselling provided by general physicians and a women doctors daily (except Sundays) between 11am and 1pm and between 3pm and 5pm.
Jharkhand became the 12th state to be integrated into the telemedicine facility of the NHM on May 1. People can login to the portal through laptops or smartphones from their home and get medical consultation for free without having to wait in line at hospital outpatient departments.
A patient will have to log in from anywhere by registering on the portal filling up some mandatory fields like phone number (for generation of OTP), name, address and will get a token number. The patient will have to again login entering the phone number and the token number and enter into the waiting room with names of doctors available for consultation and wait for turn (based on token number) to consult the doctor. After the consultation, one will have to download the e-prescription for purchasing medicines. ",states
Cyclone Amphan to bring relief from swelter," Several districts of Jharkhand are experiencing muggy weather owing to high humidity caused by moisture incursion into the atmosphere, but some relief is on the way.
The sweltering heat has upped the discomfort index and weathermen have warned of another 24 hours of torment before the state can hope for some rain in the wake of cyclone Amphan.
“The weather will continue to be humid for the next 24 hours due to the westerly wind coupled with moisture incursion into the atmosphere,” S.D. Kotal, director of the India Meteorological Department's Ranchi centre, said on Monday.
The average discomfort index, measured on the basis of temperature, humidity and wind pattern, was as high as 64°, nine notches above normal, in the state on Monday.
The index in Jamshedpur touched a tormenting 65°, 10 notches above normal, while in capital Ranchi it was 62°, seven points above normal.
In places such as Daltonganj, Bokaro and Dhanbad, the discomfort index was between 65° and 66°, much higher than the normal.
The day’s temperature on Sunday had touched an oppressive 40°C in several parts of the state, specially in the southern and north-western parts.
Chaibasa in West Singhbhum and several places in Palamau region recorded around 40°C for the second consecutive day on Monday.
Kotal said cyclone Amphan, which originated from the Bay of Bengal, would start impacting Jharkhand’s weather from Tuesday afternoon.
“Cloud formation will take place especially in those districts of Jharkhand, which are close to Bengal and Odisha. Gusty winds, rain and thunder are expected on Wednesday and Thursday,” he said.
The Met office director, however, said no warning of heavy rain had been issued for Jharkhand.
Monday’s satellite pictures suggested that cyclone Amphan was located around 780km south of Paradip (Odisha), 930km south-southwest of Digha (Bengal) and 1,050km south-southwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh). It is likely to intensify further into a super cyclone during the next 24 hours.
The cyclone is very likely to move northwards for some time and then to northwest Bay of Bengal and cross Bengal-Bangladesh coasts between Digha (Bengal) and Hatiya Islands (Bangladesh) on Wednesday afternoon.",states
Attacks on cops a sign of worry in Ranchi and places nearby," Incidents of mobs targeting police are on the rise in the state capital and places nearby.
On Sunday afternoon three police personnel, including officer-in-charge of Kanke police station, Vinay Kumar Singh, and two constables accompanying him, Parvinder Kumar, and Upendra Sah, suffered injuries after villagers attacked them at Nagri, about 18km from the district headquarters under the jurisdiction of Kanke police station.
They had gone to rescue three persons accused of opening fire on paan shop owner Samshad Ansari alias Guddu.
“Around 200 villagers laid siege on the office where the accused were hiding. As Vinay Kumar Singh heard about it he rushed to rescue around 3.15pm. As villagers realised that the police had come to rescue the accused, they got infuriated and attacked the police team and damaged their vehicles with sticks and stones,” a locality resident said.
Singh confirmed the incident saying he had minor injuries on his left hand, shoulder and knee, and his constables suffered head injuries.

“I am alright but my constables have head injuries and doctors suggested CT scan. Villagers would have lynched the accused in case we had not reached on time,” Singh said.
Asked the reason behind opening fire on Guddu, Singh said: “It was a dispute over collection of Rs 5,000 which Guddu had given to the accused Saddam, Raja and David Sanga. We are investigating it.”
Police were also attacked on May 15 at Parhepat, a village about 18km from the city under Ratu police station area. An FIR o the incident was registered on May 16. A total of 195 men and women have been made accused in the incident. Out of 195 as many as 70 have been named, while 125 are unnamed. On Sunday police arrested eight of them.

“I saw them selling bhindi, karela, cucumber and watermelon,” said Deepak Mazumdar, a resident of Burdwan Compound.
Ratan said the idea was to impress upon people the need to support farmers.
“During the lockdown, farmers are not getting proper price of their agricultural produce. Middlemen purchase vegetables at lower prices from the farmers and farmers have no option but to sell them because bringing vegetables to the market during the lockdown is a challenge for them. So, we decided to sell their vegetables at a reasonable price and create awareness. On Sunday we sold vegetables worth Rs 5,000,” Ratan said. “The farmers got Rs 20 for a kilo of karela for which they used to get less than Rs 10 per kg. Similar was the return for watermelon and karela.”
Ravindra Singh, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee in-charge (organisation), insisted that the initiative should not be seen through the prism of politics.
“It is an attempt to draw the attention of common people towards farmers,” Singh said. “The state government has taken steps to ensure that farmers get proper price for their produce. Vegfed and other co-operatives are looking into it. With the initiative of (state agriculture) minister (Badal) Patralekh vegetables were also sent outside the state during the lockdown.”",states
Shed goes down at Shalimar station," A platform shed under construction at Shalimar station in Howrah collapsed on Monday afternoon, killing a labourer and injuring at least another.
No passengers were harmed, railway officials said.
The 70ft-long and 50ft-wide concrete structure that collapsed on Monday had been cast in May, an official of the Railway Protection Force said. Its scaffolding was being removed when the structure came crashing.
“The shed at the rear end of platforms 2 and 3, where there is no passenger movement, came crashing down around 2.55pm,” a railway official said.
A few labourers were trapped under the debris for over 30 minutes before help arrived, some residents and passengers alleged.

But railway officials said only two persons were admitted to hospital.
The dead labourer has been identified by the railways as Dukha Chaupal. A portion of an electric pole fell on him, witnesses said. The injured, Alamgir Mallik, is undergoing treatment at Howrah State General Hospital.
An official of South Eastern Railway, under which Shalimar station falls, said the yard master and some railway employees had rushed to the spot immediately after the crash. “But some residents beat up the yard master,” he said. Yard master Dulal Biswas was admitted to hospital with head injuries, he said.
“The general manager, Sanjay Kumar Mohanty, has formed a high-level committee to probe the incident. The reason of the crash will be clear after the panel submits its report,” said Sanjoy Ghosh, the spokesperson for South Eastern Railway.
The shade had been built under an upgrade plan for the station sanctioned by Mamata Banerjee, the then railway minister, in 2010-11. The contract had been awarded to IRCON International Ltd, a central government undertaking incorporated by the railway ministry.

Bhubaneswar air pollution shoots up on Diwali," Diwali celebrations pushed up the air pollution level here by a few notches despite the efforts of the city administration to ensure an eco-friendly festival.
While pushing up the pollution level, Diwali revellers also violated the Supreme Court direction to burst crackers only between 8pm and 10pm on Wednesday.
The suspended particulate matter mapped in six major areas of the city revealed the poor state of air quality.
According to data, the suspended particulate matter (SPM) remained at 197 microgram per metre cube at Unit VII on Wednesday. The count for the area was 132 microgram per metre cube on Tuesday, while at Master Canteen the figure was 186. The count was 149 on Tuesday.
Similarly, the SPM near Rama Devi Women’s University remained at 200 microgram per metre cube on Wednesday compared to 152 on Tuesday. At Infocity, the SPM count on the two consecutive days was 176 and 135, respectively. The SPM level mapped at KIIT Square was 186 on Wednesday and 156 on Tuesday.
According to standard norms, SPM should not exceed the 100 micro grams per metre cube mark. If it goes past 100, the level of air pollution is marked as severe.
“We did make the plea to follow the norms. Police have also penalised several persons for defying the apex court direction,” said mayor Ananta Narayan Jena. The pollution level, however, was not so alarming during last year’s Diwali. Last year’s data show that the SPM at Unit VIII was 141 microgram per meter cube, while at Palasuni and Unit I it were 123 and 108, respectively, after Diwali.
“The weather condition also contributed to the increasing pollution level besides bursting of crackers and the ongoing construction work in various parts of the city. We have compiled the data and will come up with plans to control the level of air pollution in the city,” said a senior official of the pollution control board.
Besides, hospitals across city also received cases of burns and patients complaining of respiratory trouble on Wednesday night.
At Capital Hospital three patients had come with minor burns and four with respiratory problems. “We had kept a special ward ready for such patients,” said hospital director Chitta Ranjan Das.
Patia resident Geetanjali Dash said that it seemed that people felt happy to break rules and cared less for adverse consequences.
“Bursting of crackers went on till late Wednesday night and it contributed in a big way to the air pollution. People need to get sensitised and act sensibly to save the environment,” said Dash, a schoolteacher.",states
Fire on top floor of Fancy Market," A fire broke out on the top floor of the four-storey Fancy Market building in Kidderpore on Monday night.
The top floor of the building houses a bar-cum-restaurant and a garments godown.
No one was trapped or injured in the fire that was doused with the help of seven fire tenders. Residents lent a helping hand. The flames were contained within half an hour.
The fire broke out a few minutes after 9pm, said Shahjahan Ahmed, who runs a shop across the road in front of Fancy Market.
“We saw huge flames coming out of the top floor of the building. There is a bar on the top floor. But luckily no one was injured or trapped in the fire,” Ahmed said.
Police suspect the fire originated in a garments godown adjoining Zaika Sports Bar, sources said.
“The godown has a tin shed. We are suspecting the fire started there,” a police officer said.
Most of the shops and godowns at Fancy Market, known as one of the busiest and cheapest markets in the city, do not follow fire safety norms, police said.
Mohammad Kamiruddin, a member of the market committee, however, said there were four fire extinguishers in the building, all of which were exhausted while fighting the flames on Monday night. Around four more extinguishers were brought from the adjoining Five-Star Market and used to douse the flames.
Fancy Market is located in a congested area surrounded by residential and commercial buildings.
Had the fire spread, it could have damaged hundreds of shops and homes and led to a huge loss of life and property.
Mayor Firhad Hakim visited the spot. He said it would be ascertained if the shops were prepared to fight a fire in case of an emergency.
Shanties gutted

Bangladesh Hilsa gift for Durga Puja trickles in," Eight trucks carrying 30.5 tonnes of Bangladeshi Hilsa out of 500 tonnes promised by Dhaka arrived in Bengal late on Monday evening after a day-long wait blamed on sluggish Indian customs clearances at the Petrapole border in Bongaon, North 24-Parganas.
The Sheikh Hasina government had last week announced that it would export the Hilsas to India as a Puja goodwill gesture.
The remaining 429.5 tonnes will arrive through the Petrapole border, around 71km from Calcutta, in phases by October 10, officials and agents said.
Feroz Mandal, a clearing agent, said the Bangladeshi authorities had sent the consignment by afternoon but the delay was caused by the Indian officials. “Exporters and agents have agreed to work together during the festival so that the rest of the Hilsas can arrive.”
Sources in Petrapole said the unloading of Hilsa from the Bangladeshi trucks began late in the evening on Monday. Packed in theromocol boxes with ice, the fish was then loaded onto Indian trucks.

Exporters and wholesale fish traders in Calcutta and Howrah said they were relieved and expect the Hilsas to be readily available in another day or two.
“We have been trying for this since 2012. Hopefully, the price of Hilsa would be now within the reach of fish lovers,” said Syed Anwar Maqsood, secretary of the West Bengal Fish Importers’ Association. Hilsa prices in have been hovering around Rs 1,600 a kg.
The production of Hilsa has been declining over the years.
Sources in the market said the production has dwindled from 80,000 tonnes in 2001 to nearly 15,000 tonnes in 2013 to around 10,000 tonnes in 2017 largely because of over-fishing in the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh has been able to check the declining Hilsa population by banning fishing during the breeding period and establishing sanctuaries for the fish. ",states
Food for needy over Harry Potter books for Habra boy," Eight-year old Mriganka had been saving up for over three years to buy the complete set of Harry Potter books, but he decided to empty his little blue bag for a community kitchen instead.
The Class III boy was reading a book sitting in the balcony of his home at Habra in North 24-Parganas when he saw a group of students distributing dry food among the distressed.
“Why are so many people standing in a queue for food?” he asked his father Manoj Das, an accountant in Burrabazar.
Mriganka’s father explained to him how many had been robbed of their livelihood during the lockdown. “He said he wanted to give his savings to the aunty across the lane,” Manoj said. When Mriganka handed over the blue cotton bag with all his savings to volunteers running a community kitchen to feed the poor, they were surprised.
“He just told me ‘I have come to give you this’, handed me the bag and sprinted away,” said Anindita Dutta, a former student of Presidency University who is associated with the drive. “Later, his father told me that the boy had donated his savings of three years to help our cause. He thought many are still unfed and wanted to help through our initiative.”
Anindita, who completed her master’s from Presidency last year, opened the bag to find a collection of coins and a few crumpled notes that added up to around Rs 500. Quarantined Student-Youth Network — the group of present and former students of Presidency University and other institutions — have been feeding the poor in pockets of North 24-Parganas. But donations have started drying up because of an unprecedented slump in business.
“All is not lost,” said Anindita, who lives across the lane from Mriganka’s home in in Naba Palli off Jessore Road in Habra. “It has given us a new lease of life. If he can go the extra mile, why can’t we?”
Arkopal Dutta, a batch mate of Anindita, said: “We hope the story of Mriganka would inspire more to step forward.”",states
Neighbours put up ‘barricade’ around house," A doctor who tested positive for Covid-19 last week and decided to stay in home isolation because she had mild symptoms alleged that the local civic body and some residents of the area had been pressuring her to get admitted to hospital and some people had put up a barricade in front of her house.
The doctor attached to Peerless Hospital said her husband, who is also a doctor with another private hospital, has been facing problems from his doctor colleagues.
The woman, who stays in the Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality area, had tested positive for Covid-19 last Tuesday. “Since I had almost no symptoms, I decided to stay in home isolation. Being a doctor, I will be able to analyse my health conditions and I know the rules of isolation. Besides, a government health official is calling me up every day to monitor my condition,” she said on Sunday.
Some civic officials allegedly called her up on the first two days of isolation and insisted that she get get admitted to a hospital.
“One of them told me that since I was a doctor with Peerless Hospital, I could get admitted there,” the doctor said. She alleged that some neighbours had also called her up, asking her to get admitted to a hospital.
Ajoy Krishna Sarkar, physician and in-charge of Peerless Hospital’s intensive therapy unit, intervened and sought police help.
The doctor couple’s home was allegedly barricaded with bamboo poles on Saturday. “I called the police and the municipality and they were surprised. Neither had set up the barricade. Later, it was revealed that some residents had put it up. The poles were removed,” she said.
The ministry of health and family welfare had last month issued guidelines, stating that pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients or those with very mild symptoms can stay in home isolation provided they follow norms such as wearing a triple-layer mask, stay in one room, away from other people at home, specially the elderly, and not share personal items with other people.
“My husband and son, who is 11, are staying in other rooms. My in-laws live in the same building but in a separate flat. I am not going out and the local councillor has arranged for all our daily supplies,” she said.
The doctor said one of her colleagues at Peerless had faced similar problems when she tested positive for the coronavirus. “I had thought people would slowly become more empathetic. But my personal experience is that there is lack of awareness,” she said.
Residents of the area where the doctor couple live have also submitted a petition to the local councillor, demanding that the road in front of their house be blocked.
“They have been calling me up every day and asking why the doctor was not sent to the hospital,” said Nitu Das, the Trinamul councillor of ward 31 of Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality. “I have been visiting neighbourhoods, trying to prevent panic and rumours but it’s an impossible task.”
When a nurse of a private hospital tested positive in the area, residents had drawn up a list of five to six other nurses staying in the area, the councillor said. “They came to me with the list and wanted the nurses to leave. But I resisted the pressure.”
Sarkar, the doctor’s colleague who helped her, said such behaviour was unfortunate. “She never refused to treat patients after the outbreak of Covid-19, But if doctors like her become social outcast, then other doctors will be scared to treat patients,” Sarkar said.
A resident of the area said they were concerned about safety. “We have nothing against her, but there are vendors going to their house every day and the chance of Covid-19 spreading in our area becomes higher. So we are concerned and want the road to be blocked.”",states
Paralysed septuagenarian forced out of rented flat," A septuagenarian lady, just out of hospital, was hounded out of a rented flat in Dhakuria by some residents for fear of “the spread of Covid-19 from an outsider”, her son has alleged.
The woman, paralysed for the past seven years, was admitted to a private nursing home in Gariahat for close to two months for acute arthritis and bedsore. She had to be taken out on Saturday, before the clinic was shut down because the Covid-19 crisis has led to the absence of many doctors.
The doctor treating the 75-year-old woman, a co-owner of the nursing home, said she “did not have any symptoms of Covid-19”.
The woman was brought to the ground floor flat of a building in Dhakuria’s Telipara around 3pm on Saturday. Her son, Bhaskar Sinha, had rented the flat because his apartment in the same neighbourhood “did not have the infrastructure to accommodate a 24X7 attendant my mother would need”.
By evening, he was forced to shift his mother to his old flat because the protesting residents did not budge even after a stand-off for hours and police intervention.

“I showed all the prescriptions and other medical documents (to show his mother was not a Covid-19 patient) to the police and they were satisfied…. But the mob of more than 100 people became aggressive, completely ignoring social distancing norms,” Sinha wrote in his complaint with Garfa police station over WhatsApp. “Most of the men were not wearing masks. Some of the women had towels wrapped around their faces. They kept abusing me.”
The Centre as well as state governments have stressed the need to fight the disease and not discriminate against patients, a point reiterated multiple times by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Mobile phone caller tunes and public announcements, too, have stressed the same message.
Saturday’s incident shows how unsubstantiated fear running deep in people’s minds can create social fissures.
At least two residents who witnessed the fracas, the cops and the local councillor told Metro that a possible trigger could have been the door of the flat, which was locked from outside.
“We got a call. The caller said a woman was lying inside a flat that was locked from
outside. The woman’s son came after a short while,” an officer of Garfa police station said.
“The group that had assembled asked him to either take his mother to his own flat or live with her in the new flat. He eventually agreed to take his mother to his old flat,” the officer said.
The woman’s son has said that he sent a complaint to the police station over WhatsApp but no formal case has been drawn up so far, the officer said.
The councillor of Ward 92, Madhuchhanda Deb, said the problem started because he had locked the flat from outside. “People got suspicious,” Deb said.
Sinha said he had locked the flat after putting his mother on a bed because he needed to visit his own apartment, five minutes away, for a change of clothes and a shower. “I could not have left the door open with my mother inside,” Sinha said.
“The attendant who looked after her for two months at the hospital had agreed to stay with her at the flat. I asked her to collect her clothes and other stuff from her home (in Garia) and reach the flat later in the day. After placing my mother on a bed, I locked the flat from outside and came to my home. I had alerted the landlord’s father before leaving the flat,” he said.
He got a call from the landlord and rushed back to see “a crowd” outside the flat. “The mob would hear nothing. They had one demand — that I shift my mother out. When I finally sought 48 hours, a woman said they would not give me even 48 minutes,” Sinha told Metro.
He said he had called up the councillor for help “but in vain”. “I had to relent because the crowd was turning more aggressive every minute,” he said.",states
Assam coronavirus count rises to 100," Two more Assam districts — Sonitpur and Sivasagar — recorded their first Covid-19 positive cases on Sunday. Both of the patients had returned to the state recently after the lockdown restrictions were eased by the Centre.
In the evening, three persons tested positive for Covid-19 at the Sarusajai quarantine centre in Guwahati. Two of them came from Mumbai, while one arrived from Bihar.
With one case each in these two districts, as well as seven other fresh cases in Kamrup (metro), Cachar and Jorhat, the state’s Covid-19 count rose to 100 so far, of which 55 are active cases.
“Altogether 15 districts have reported Covid-19 positive cases out of the 33 districts. They include Golaghat, Morigaon, Dhubri, Nalbari, Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Cachar, Hailakandi, Karimganj, Kamrup, Kamrup (metro), Lakhimpur, Sivasagar, Sonitpur and South Salmara-Mankachar,” said a health department official, adding that around 31,276 samples have been tested across the state so far.
While the patient in Sonitpur district had returned from Calcutta a few days back, the persons infected in Sivasagar and Jorhat had travelled back from Delhi. The Cachar patient also returned from Chennai on Saturday.
Jorhat deputy commissioner Roshni Aparanji Korati said, “The positive cases in Sivasagar and Jorhat had travelled from Delhi with others and reached Assam on May 14. They were all asymptomatic.”
The Jorhat patient, a nine-year-old boy, has become the state’s youngest Covid-19 case.
Already, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal had said that the return of thousands of stranded people to the state would pose a major challenge. “It’s a Himalayan task to deal with the incoming of these large numbers of people,” he had said.
According to the Northeast Frontier Railway, till Sunday, more than 5,000 passengers had travelled in the four special passenger trains between New Delhi and Dibrugarh.
NFR chief public relations officer Subhanan Chanda said, “Altogether 567 passengers de-boarded at Guwahati and 887 at Dibrugarh. So, it is evident that a good number of people are availing the newly introduced special passenger trains. Another weekly passenger train service will start from Monday. It will connect Agartala with New Delhi, which will provide connectivity to the people of Tripura, Manipur, Mizoram apart from south Assam districts.”
The Hailakandi district administration has set up additional quarantine facilities to accommodate those coming from outside the state, said deputy commissioner M.N. Dahal.",states
"Worry over rising Covid-19 cases, containment zones in Guwahati"," Concern and fear continued to grow among residents of Assam’s capital, as the number of Covid-19 cases and containment zones continued to rise.
On Saturday night, two more Covid-19 cases were detected in the city’s Fatasil and Kalapahar areas. One of them is linked to the Fancy Bazar Covid-19 case. Of the 100 positive cases in Assam, the city alone has recorded at least 34.
Not being able to identify the source of infections in most cases was adding to the worry. State health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has admitted that the source of the cases was still unknown but appealed to the residents not to press the panic button and strictly observe lockdown restrictions.
On Sunday again, he reiterated, “In view of developing situation, I urge people over 65 years and children below 10 years to strictly stay inside, unless very important.”
Sarma had earlier expressed his displeasure over some residents’ apparent indifference to the coronavirus threat by taking out children, including toddlers.

The city is also bearing the additional brunt for being the gateway to the Northeast.
On Sunday, two areas — Katahbari and Rukminigaon — had to be declared as containment zones after two persons from Tripura tested positive in the neighbouring state. They had visited local shops here.
Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner Biswajit Pegu said, “Both of them left for Tripura on May 13. We are taking the swab samples from the people of the neighbourhood and tracing their contact histories as well.”
Besides, the city’s Fatasil Tiniali area too was declared a containment zone after another person tested positive.
So far, the city has 11 containment zones, 10 of which were declared this month.
The business hub of Fancy Bazar still remains affected as majority of the city’s Covid-19 cases had a direct link with the first coronavirus patients detected in the area.
Although the Kamrup Chamber of Commerce (KCC)’s call for a three-day closure of the busy market to prevent the spread of the virus ended on Saturday, normalcy is unlikely to return till the test results of all the samples collected from the area come out. Over 300 swab samples have been collected there.
“Since business in the area is mostly labour-dependent, it will be unwise to start operations without knowing who is affected. Saving Fancy Bazar will mean saving the city. The need of the hour is to get everyone tested,” a trader said. Concern over the disease spreading to the slums along the railway tracks, bordering the business hub, is growing.
“These people have been living in unhygienic conditions and are currently without jobs. The administration must sanitise these areas and educate the people about the virus. They are vulnerable and will also make the city vulnerable at the same time,” said Arindom Bora, a local distributing ration among the slum-dwellers.
P.P. Singh, who has been distributing relief in the city with his Khalsa team members, said the population living along the tracks was a ticking time bomb. “All government agencies, including the railways, should launch joint efforts to properly sanitise the areas once things return to normal,” he said.
Cong slams minister
The Assam unit of the Congress on Sunday hit back at Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for describing party leader Rahul Gandhi meeting migrant workers in Delhi on Saturday as “dramebaazi”. PCC president Ripun Bora said it is the BJP, not Congress, who does drama.
“I want to remind Sitharaman how Prime Minister Narendra Modi had washed feet of workers. The same Modi now does not have sympathy for the migrants who are suffering because of the lockdown and forced to walk thousands of kilometres to reach home,” said Bora.
He added by describing Rahul meeting the migrants as “dramebaazi”, Sitharaman had insulted lakhs of workers.
Leader of the Opposition Debabrata Saikia, criticised the economic packages announced by Sitharaman.
According to Saikia, the economic package announced by the Centre will help only the rich. Saikia said even the industrialists are not happy with the package. He said through the economic package the Centre is only trying to give loans to the distressed people instead of giving financial assistance. ",states
Onion adds zing to JMM poll recipe," The Opposition has found a weapon against the ruling BJP in the onion prices that are going up faster than one can say 'inflation'.
The JMM candidate for Ranchi Assembly seat, Mahua Maji, on Wednesday hit the streets of the capital wearing a garland of onions.She is fighting against the BJP's C.P. Singh, the incumbent urban development minister.
Maji along with her supporters visited several parts of the constituency including Tharpakna asking people to vote for her, and she focused on women as her target voters.
'We are contesting the election on the basis of basic is- sues that have been affecting common people and the soaring price of onion is the most crucial one. Hence, today we decided to start campaigning with onions,' said Maji.
The onions did add zing to her campaign, with several onlookers smiling at the barb at the government.
'It is more than one month that the price of onion has kept on soaring and now it costs Rs 100 per kg,' Maji said.
'It has affected household budgets. Hotel owners are suffering loss because they can't increase the price of the food. Worst thing is that the price hike has taken place during the wedding seasonVoters of Ranchi expressed displeasure over the failure of the government to curb the price of the staple. 'The BJP and the entire government machinery is engaged in the election and nobody actually cares to check the price hike,' said Sabita Mishra, a homemaker. 'Controlling price is responsibility of the department of food civil supplies and consumer affairs. Funniest thing is that minister of the department, Saryu Roy, is contesting against chief minister Raghubar Das as a rebel. He is the same minister who in the past had intervened in such matters and used to set up government-run shops to control the price. I remember a couple years back the price of arhar dal had soared and he had taken effective measuresGinni Devi, another homemaker, said that a few weeks back Biscomaun, a cooperative society of Bihar, and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd had started selling onions at controlled prices in Ranchi and other parts of Jharkhand.
'I had brought onions from them but the stock exhausted. Now I am neither buying nor using onions to prepare vegetables. At frequent intervals we face problems due to the hike in the price of onion,' she said.
However, there were others who felt that the onion can't be a poll issue. 'Onions can't decide whom I am going to vote for,' said Shweta Pandey Mishra, also a Ranchibased homemaker.
'Price hike is an important issue that has affected middle and lower income groups of the society. I will vote for the party that can check price hike and bring overall development.'.",states
Sunday date with ultra run," An ultramarathon off the beaten track will attract more than 200 runners before sunrise on Sunday.
The 60-km run, dubbed the city’s only ultramarathon, will traverse the expanse of the East Calcutta Wetlands. The trail of pebbled tracks cutting through the wetlands with runners making their way past cows, ducks and cycles offer a unique experience for seasoned and amateur runners used to sweating it out on smooth city roads.
The Kolkata Ultra 60, in association with The Telegraph, will start from Urbana off the Bypass. Runners will have to complete a 20-km course three times, individually or as a team.
“Ultra marathon is a niche category. The distance of 60km is very challenging. So, we have divided the race into two categories — individual and team,” an organiser said.
Participants can take part in teams of three with at least one female participant. Each will have to complete the stretch once in the relay format.

Blame game over craters on Bypass stretch," A stretch of the Science City-bound flank of the EM Bypass, near the Ruby hospital crossing, is dotted with multiple potholes forcing vehicles to swerve right and left to avoid them.
The road remains damaged even though the monsoon left the state in October.
The Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) have blamed each other for the bad road. Both agencies are equally responsible for maintaining the stretch where a Metro construction is on.
A daily commuter said it was more than a month that the 150m stretch had been lying in such battered condition. Two-wheelers and four-wheelers suddenly have to slam brakes or are forced to swerve dangerously to avoid the craters, he said. The commuter apprehended an accident some day as vehicles swerve in high speed on the stretch.stretches,” said the CMDA official, adding that it could be one of the reasons why the stretch gets damaged so often. An official of the CMDA, the custodian of the Bypass, said that the RVNL, which is building the New Garia-Airport Metro corridor, was tasked to maintain the stretch. The Ruby crossing station (Hemanta Mukherjee) is being built along the road where the potholes have appeared.
“The RVNL has even written to us and committed itself to maintaining the stretch. There are eight stations of Metro on the Bypass and RVNL is supposed to maintain a 250-metre stretch near each on both flanks of the Bypass,” said the CMDA official.
An RVNL official countered the claim of the CMDA official. He said the RVNL was only supposed to pay for the repairs.
“The agreement between us and the CMDA is that they will do the repairs and we will pay,” he said.
The RVNL official added that there were several other stretches on the Bypass, taken together about 2km, where Metro construction is not going on but the roads were still dotted with potholes. The repair of stretches of the Bypass has been a contentious issue between the RVNL and the CMDA.
On Sunday, a relatively less traffic day, Metro found all vehicles slowing down, veering right or left to avoid the potholes.
The broken stretch, towards the left of the 15metre-wide flank, was supposed to be a green verge and a cycle track and hence its bed is not very strong, the CMDA official said. The original road is now barricaded for the construction of the Hemanta Mukherjee station near the Ruby crossing.
“To create space for vehicles, the portion reserved originally for green verge and cycle track was made into a road. But it’s not as hard as other ",states
Fraud via food refund," A plate of biryani that never got delivered cost a man Rs 11,000.
The amount was allegedly withdrawn from Rishab Ghosh’s account when he tried to seek a refund by calling the delivery service number available on Google search.
Ghosh was allegedly made to share his card details through a link provided to him.
A police complaint has been lodged.
Ghosh, a resident of Haridevpur, was working at a studio in Jadavpur where he placed an order for a plate of chicken biryani with egg and paid online.
The food was not delivered and Ghosh called the food delivery service to seek a refund. The person who received the call allegedly asked Ghosh to fill in an online form. “He was asked to fill in his card details and asked to share a one-time password sent to his phone. After a few minutes, he received a text message saying Rs 11,000 had been deducted from his account,” an officer of Jadavpur police station said.
A similar online fraud reported in Metro on November 30 involved a gang of from Jamtara in Jharkhand that managed to edit the contact details of a popular chain of restaurants on the Google search engine and cheated several customers by luring them into sharing their card details for pre-booking a table for only Rs 10. Three people were arrested.
The police are yet to ascertain if the same gang was involved in both cases.
Girish Park police station had received a similar complaint a few weeks ago from a customer who had ordered food online.",states
Onion sells at Rs 140 a kilo," Onions sold at Rs 140 a kilo in Calcutta on Wednesday and traders fear the price may rise further as supplies from Nashik in Maharashtra have dropped drastically.
Traders across wholesale markets in the city said the onion price would only stabilise after new crop reaches the market a few weeks later.
Traders said the price of onions touched Rs 140 a kg at Lake and Gariahat markets and Jadu Babu’s Bazar in Bhowanipore.
On Tuesday, 21 truckloads of onions reached the wholesale hubs in Posta and Burrabazar from Nashik, compared with the usual supply of 60 to 70 trucks.
On Wednesday, only two trucks carrying 16 tonnes of onions each reached Koley Market, one of the biggest wholesale hubs of vegetables. Traders said 10 to 12 trucks would usually reach the Sealdah market daily.
“Usually, Koley Market gets 160 to 165 tonnes of onions daily,” said Kamal Dey, a member of the state task force on vegetables. “Prices are likely to shoot over the next few weeks because the gap between demand and supply will keep increasing.”
Calcutta consumes around 1,800 tonnes of onion and the bulk of the supply comes from Maharashtra, where a flood in September had left wholesale onion markets across Pune reeling from a crisis.
As supplies dwindled, the onion price in Calcutta started to rise. Then came Cyclone Bulbul, which made landfall in the Bengal coast on November 9 and left large swathes of farmland across North and South 24-Parganas inundated for days.
Vegetable prices started to soar under the impact of the cyclone.
At wholesale markets, the price of onion varied between Rs 4,300 and Rs 4,200 for every 40kg pack on Wednesday.
“Add to that the labour charge for unloading the packets. Market owners charge five per cent commission. Finally, when the depleted stock of onions reach the retail markets, the price varies between Rs 135 and Rs 140 a kilo,” said Mahadev Basak, a retailer in Kasba.
The price hike has forced homemakers to cut down their daily intake and some have even started learning recipes that do not have onion.
“I now buy around 100g of onion every alternate day,” said Shukla Ghosh, a resident of Beleghata.
Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday asked officials to ensure that Sufal Bangla counters across Calcutta continued selling onions at Rs 59 a kilo. “We are struggling to find ways to source onions so that more counters can be set up to sale them,” an official in the agricultural marketing department said.",states
Van with visitors stalls in tiger park," Around 15 tourists had to spend over 20 minutes in panic inside a van that broke down in the tiger enclosure of the Bengal Safari Park near here on Wednesday afternoon.
“The vehicle developed a technical snag when it was about to exit the enclosure after a 45-minute safari. The tourists could come out after the staff of the Bengal forest department guided all four tigers to cages and the van was towed out of the park by a second vehicle,” said Dharamdeo Rai, director of the park.
Sources have said the park has 10 multi utility vehicles which are covered with iron mesh and thick glasses to protest the occupants from tigers and other animals.
“All the vehicles are regularly checked. Today, the driver tried to restart the vehicle when it came to a halt, but he couldn’t. We will examine the vehicle and find out how the technical fault occurred,” said Rai.
The park is located on the fringes of the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary and around 9km from here. It is spread over 297 hectares, of which 20 hectares are for the tiger enclosure.
Two adult tigers — Shila and Bevan — and cubs Rika and Kika are in the enclosure now. The cubs had been born captive at the park and were released in the enclosure on October 1.
One of the visitors who were stuck in the tiger enclosure said: “We were all thrilled by the experience of seeing the tiger in the wild. When our vehicle suddenly came to a halt, we panicked. The driver was trying desperately to restart the vehicle, but he failed. There were children and senior citizens in the vehicle and they all turned pale as four tigers were roaming freely outside the van,” said the tourist.
The driver immediately contacted the park authorities over phone.
“As per the standard protocol, we first sent back the animals to the shelters. Then another vehicle was sent inside and pulled the stranded vehicle out of the enclosure. The entire process took around 20 minutes,” said Rai.
The forest department has recently decided to add five more hectares to the tiger enclosure for a captive breeding centre. The facility is likely to come up next year.",states

She said another team led by TWA vice-president was also touring the country with the same purpose. Each group will visit 25 cities to garner support for the cause.
She said the main issues that they wanted to discuss with the Indian leaders were human rights violation in Tibet, 24 years of disappearance of the 11th Panchen Lama of Tibet and deterioration of Tibetan atmosphere.
“Indian leaders often go abroad on official trips and we expect them to raise our issues with the international community so that China could be pressured to look into our demands,” Tsering told reporters at Potala Market on Kutchery Road where her fellow Tibetans sell woollen garments.
“Indian leaders and people are always sympathetic to the Tibetan cause,” she said, adding this tour would help strengthen the ties further.
“We tried to get in touch with many leaders but could manage to meet only urban development minister C.P. Singh,” Tsering said.
Out of the 25 cities that this team plans to visit, Ranchi was their eighth destination. They reached here on Friday and left on Saturday.
The team also attended a programme with fellow Tibetans who are currently here to run the Potala Market.
“Indian people can create a pressure on China by boycotting Chinese goods,” Tsering said.
“Chinese goods have a huge market in India and Indians can create a pressure on Beijing by refusing to patronise their goods,” she added.",states
July date for Xavier Law School in Calcutta," The proposed law school of St Xavier’s University is set to welcome its first batch of students in July 2019.
Father Felix Raj, vice-chancellor of the university, said on Thursday Xavier Law School had been modelled on prominent law institutions such as the Nalsar University of Law, in Hyderabad; National Law School of India University, in Bangalore; and the National University of Juridical Sciences, Calcutta.
Xavier Law School will come up on the university’s 17-acre New Town campus.
The school will offer five-year integrated BA LLB (honours) and BCom LLB (honours) courses. “The syllabus and the curriculum will be designed to produce competent experts in legal profession with sound knowledge in every sphere of law. After completing the course the students can practise law in court or can work as consultant or join the corporate sector,” Felix Raj said.
The university will soon approach the Bar Council of India, which regulates legal education in the country, for affiliation. The University Grants Commission’s approval will be sought as well.
Work on setting up the infrastructure is on in full swing, the VC said.
“The most important component of any institution of higher education is its library. For a law school, it is important to have a library with an extensive collection of law books and journals,” said Felix Raj.
The law school will have “elaborate arrangements” for organising moot court competitions, which help students develop skills in debating.
Students will have to clear an “independent competitive examination”, to be conducted by the university, to gain entry into Xavier Law School.
Institutes such as the Nalsar University of Law and the National University of Juridical Sciences admit students through the Common Law Admission Test.
The first batch will have 120 students. The university may later increase its intake.
Recruitment of teachers will start soon. “Our aim is to engage the best legal experts and academics,” Felix Raj said.
The university is yet to decide the fees for the five-year programme.",states
ATM fraud count touches 59," Twenty-four complaints of fraudulent withdrawal of money from ATMs were lodged on Tuesday, taking the number of cases reported since Monday to 59.
The complainants together have lost around Rs 10 lakh, police said.
The police are urging victims to lodge complaints through their banks.
“Chances of getting back the stolen money are higher if the victims report the matter through their banks. It is the responsibility of the banks to compensate its customers because some lacunae in the security system of the ATMs might have been responsible for the fraud,” said a senior officer.
As many as 44 complaints have been lodged with Jadavpur police station — 35 on Monday and the rest on Tuesday. Thirteen complaints have been lodged with Charu Market police station and one each with Karaya and Netaji Nagar police stations.
The findings of a preliminary investigation by the police suggest that a Romanian or a Turkish gang, based in Delhi, orchestrated the fraud. Sleuths are scanning footage of at least three men wearing black caps and with their faces covered with masks withdrawing money from ATMs in Delhi.
The police said the frauds had copied card details of the victims with skimmers they had attached to ATMs in Calcutta and used the data to withdraw money from ATMs in south Delhi.
The cops have identified at least two ATMs in Calcutta — one on Tollygunge Circular Road and the other in Jadavpur’s Sulekha — from where customers’ data is suspected to have been stolen.
Both ATMs are of a nationalised bank and neither has any guard, an officer said. There are around 250 ATM kiosks in Calcutta that do not have any guard.
A high court lawyer mentioned in the complaint he lodged with Karaya police station that he had lost Rs 70,000 in seven transactions. Another person, who filed a complaint with Netaji Nagar police station, reported a loss of Rs 50,000.
At least two fraudulent transactions were reported on Tuesday. Both victims are residents of Jadavpur.
The police suspect the card data had been stolen in April. The gang waited till November and December to steal the money to ensure footage of CCTV cameras in ATMs is no longer available.
“Till now, all withdrawals have been made from ATMs in south Delhi. Our team has reached the spot and is working on the case,” said joint commissioner (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.",states
Date with films on nature,"  In the thick of the heat and dust of the Assembly elections, the state capital will host an environmental film festival on Thursday highlighting issues impacting the ecology.
“It will be a day-long festival featuring 13 short films at Vidhan Sabha Hall in Ranchi on December 5,” said Ipsita Baishya, communications coordinator of Toxics Link, a Delhi-based NGO that works for bringing toxics related information to the public domain.
Toxics Link is organising the festival in collaboration with Lok Swar, a local organisation of Ranchi that works on environmental issues.
The fest will be supported by the Swedish Society of Nature Conservation, Baishya said.
The films will highlight a variety of issues relating to environmental hazards and conservation efforts and their running time will vary from 3 minutes to 1 hour 6 minutes.

An hour-long film by journalist Puranjoy Guha Thakurata, Inferno : Jharia's Underground Fires, will focus on how people in a part of Dhanbad district of Jharkhand have been leading a risky life for decades.
Nabikei, a film by Sri Prakash, a Ranchi based national award-winning documentary filmmaker, will show the impact of uranium mining in the American south-west. This film will be the longest one in the festival, with a running time of 1 hour and 6 minutes.
The Pungti Story by Sesino Yhoshu will portray the changes seen in a Naga hamlet that transformed itself from a slaughtering village to one preserving falcons from Siberia.
The World’s Most Famous Tiger by Subbiah Nallamuthu will narrate the story of Machli, the tigress that lived in Ranthambhore National Park, while The Birdman of Chorao by Shashank Bhosale will inform about conservationist Uday Mandrekar.
Among other films, Gyamo - Queen of the Mountains by Gautam Pandey and Doel Trivedy will inform about snow leopards, one of the most elusive and least understood big cats that mostly live in trans-Himalayan landscapes above the tree line.
“The festival will help sensitise people towards ecological issues through films,” said Toxics Link associate director Satish Sinha.
“The entry will be free and anyone interested can view the films to be screened at the festival,” said Kunal Singh, coordinator of Lok Swar, adding that their target audience would include school students, film lovers and environmental activists.",states
Whip on roadside stalls," Traffic police and the civic body are trying to make the 1.5km Main Road stretch between Sarjana Chowk and Ranchi Club Complex congestion free by clearing out roadside vendors and penalising shop owners who display their items outside their shops.
A Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) official said 90 notices were served on Monday and around 40 more were served on Tuesday to such vendors and shop owners.
“In the notices it has been clearly written that those caught carrying out their business on the road will be prosecuted as per law and repeat offenders could be sent to jail without any warrant,” the official said.
Mohammed Tanveer, who sells footwear near Sarjana Chowk, said he had reduced the size of his makeshift shop after getting a notice.
“Traffic personnel and civic body officials asked me to carry out my business 6 feet behind the white line on the road on Monday and I am worried since then. After the instruction I reduced the size of my makeshift shop and am worried about the business prospects of a small shop on Main Road,” said Tanveer, who said he has been doing business there for the last 25 years.
Mohammed Majnu, a garment seller near Hanuman Temple on Main Road, echoed Tanveer. “We are being asked to go 6 feet behind the white line as traffic personnel want this place for the use of pedestrians. Though majority of the vendors are taking it negatively, but when movement of pedestrians will increase business will also increase, “Majnu said.
Municipal commissioner Manoj Kumar said the exercise was being undertaken to streamline the traffic in the city.
“We have demarcated parking space on Main Road but despite this vehicles are being parked on the road as vendors have encroached upon the parking spaces and pedestrian paths. Thus we have decided to warn the encroachers to vacate the encroached area,” Kumar said.
Superintendent of police (traffic) Ajit Peter Dungdung said violators would not be spared.
“As we have planned to fix plastic bollards on the road and want no one crossing them, we are taking this action. If anyone will be found crossing the plastic bollards despite our warning, they will be dealt with an iron hand,” Dungdung said.
So far action has not been taken against any vendor, he said.",states
Storm over Bulbul ‘aid’ from Centre," The Bengal government has contested the BJP’s claims that the Centre released Rs 414.90 crore for rehabilitation and restoration work in areas hit by Cyclone Bulbul.
BJP leaders have cited a release of the Centre’s Press Information Bureau to claim the Narendra Modi government had released Rs 414.90 crore after the calamity last month. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Monday that the Centre was yet to release any funds.
On Tuesday, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha claimed “the Centre had sent funds twice and that the state government “is unnecessarily blaming the Centre”.
However, Bengal junior health minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said the funds had been released in April 2019 — much before Bulbul hit the state. “It was a routine release as a part of the Centre’s responsibility. The Centre is bound to release its share under the SDRF (state disaster response fund). It has no connection with Bulbul,” said Bhattacharya.
On Tuesday, junior Union home G. Kishan Reddy told the Lok Sabha that Bengal had not yet submitted its “memorandum” for more NDRF aid. Though the state has submitted a report pegging losses from the cyclone at Rs 23,811 crore, sources said the demand must be sent in a prescribed format. ",states
On tracks trigger train blockade," Train services between Dum Dum and Belghoria were suspended for one-and-a-half hours on Tuesday after a group of people put up a blockade to protest the deaths of a girl and her grandfather who were crossing the tracks on the way to her school.
The blockade was raised with the demand for a footbridge in front of Agnisikha club between Dum Dum and Belghoria where the two were run over by a Sealdah-bound train around 10.45am.
The deceased were Juin Dhar, a Class I student of Baranagar Tirtha Bharati School, and her grandfather, Rajat Dhar, 67. She was scheduled to write her Bengali exam on Tuesday.
Local residents and guardians of the students who cross the tracks in the area put up the blockades at 12.05pm. The protest was withdrawn at 1.25pm after police had promised to take up the demand for the footbridge with Eastern Railway.
A protester said the road to the school remained crowded by traffic and hence, children had to take a shortcut by crossing the tracks. “Many accidents had occurred at the spot earlier,” said Chhaya Chatterjee, a local resident.
Six pairs of trains between Sealdah and Barrackpore had to be cancelled following the blockade. ",states
Food checks on trains," South Eastern Railway ( SER) has involved its officers and inspectors in trains and on platforms in its latest initiative to ensure quality food for railway passengers.
Data released by Garden Reach, the Calcutta-based headquarters of the SER, revealed that this year till October-end the railway has collected Rs 27.18 lakh as fine from vendors.
In the corresponding period last year, the figure was Rs 5 lakh.
SER chief public relations officer Sanjay Ghosh said several initiatives have been taken to improve services.
“The kitchen units have been upgraded and CCTVs have been installed in kitchens for monitoring,” he said.
“Certification of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has been made mandatory for ensuring compliance of food safety norms.
“Moreover, third-party audit has been implemented for examining hygiene and cleanliness in pantry cars and kitchen units,” he added.
Last month, the SER had imposed a blanket ban on a la carte meals (food ordered as separate items rather than part of a set meal) in all mail and express trains passing through divisions under it including Ranchi and Chakradharpur.
The railway zone also for the first time introduced a “snack meal” with regional cuisine and flavours.
Extra coaches
To clear the yearend rush of passengers, the SER will introduce extra coaches till December 31 for the Howrah-Koraput Express and Hatia-Purnia Court Express.
The Howrah- Koraput Express will get one extra AC 3-Tier and one extra sleeper-class coach.
The Hatia-Purnia Court Express will get one extra AC 2-tier and one extra AC 3-tier coach.",states
Insurgency situations vary in states: Tarun Gogoi," Former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi on Saturday said insurgencies in different northeastern states have to be dealt with differently, on a case-by-case basis.
Gogoi was speaking at a youth conclave, organised by Inside NE, a Guwahati-based online news portal, here.
The Congress veteran said the role of his (erstwhile) government was to bring the militants to the mainstream and not “finish them”. “The only way to finish insurgency in the state is by negotiating peace talks with them. There is no other alternative to finish insurgency in the region. We have to understand what route is better — democracy or armed,” he added.
Gogoi said the reasons and problems related to insurgency varied from place to place in the Northeast.
“Manipur’s problem is different, Nagaland’s problem is different, Assam’s problem is different and so on. You can’t have the same solution for all. We have to understand their problems and solve it in a democratic manner,” he said.
Manipur deputy chief minister Y. Joykumar Singh, who was on the panel, said subsequent governments at the Centre have never been able to understand the people of the Northeast and what they want. “Each and every insurgency situation in the Northeast is unique,” he said.
Gogoi, too, said central governments have failed to understand the problems of the Northeast. Economic development is the key to curb insurgency in the state, he said. “In my tenure, the slogan was development will come first, peace will follow. If there is proper infrastructure, connectivity, construction of roads and bridges, and job generation, then people’s attention will not be diverted and insurgency will be controlled,” Gogoi said.
When a student said that after 2014, it has become a trend for youths to join militancy, Gogoi said it was primarily because of lack of economic development in the region.
“The GDP should have risen. Instead, it has plunged to 4.5 per cent…youths are unemployed. We have to provide youths with employment opportunities, develop education infrastructure in the state,” he said. If these basic issues are not resolved, insurgency might spread like wildfire, he warned.",states
For BJP entry chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai," The doors of the BJP are open for all those who chant “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”.
That’s what Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, national spokesperson of the BJP and former Union minister, said in reply to a query from The Telegraph on why his party imported so many leaders from other parties to contest the Assembly election in Jharkhand while the party claimed to have 17 crore members across the country.
“Koi Bangladesh se aaya kya? BJP ka darwaza kisi ke liye band nahi. Jo bhi Bharat Mata Ki Jai kahega usko humarein party mein swaagat hai (Has anyone joined from Bangladesh? Whoever says Bharat Mata Ki Jai they are welcome in our party),” Shahnawaz said.
Replying to another query on how many Bangladeshi citizens the party had deported in five years of being in power at the Centre though it often claims to do so and creates a sense of terror among a section of people in the country by harping on the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Shahnawaz said it would be done soon.
“NRC will be implemented across the country at one go. Those who are staying in the country to save their freedom of religion will be given citizenship while others will be asked to go back to their motherland. It does not have to do anything with religion. No Indian should be afraid of it,” he said.
Earlier, Hussain took a dig at the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance government in Maharashtra.
“The BJP did not compromise with its principles. When it had alliance with Mehbooba Mufti in Kashmir the party made her chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai and killed terrorists like Burhan Wani,” Hussain said.
Asked whether the party would enter into an alliance with its old ally Ajsu Party in case the BJP did not get majority on its own in Jharkhand, Hussain iterated the party slogan, Abki Baar 65 Paar.
“The party is confident of winning 65 seats this time. If someone comes to become 66th, 67th and 68th, we will think over it,” Hussain said.
Asked how he was so confident of winning 65 seats, he said: “Hamare paas Modi hai (We have Modi).” He added: “Modi hamari mazbooti hai aur Rahul unki kamzori hai (Modi is our strength, Rahul is their weakness).
Asked about the GDP growth slowing down and increasing prices of staples such as onions, Hussain said: “In the first quarter GDP remained low but it was better than any of the nations of the G-20 and the slowdown was very low in comparison to the economic slowdown across the world. “Do not worry. We are going to make India a $5 trillion economy,” he added.",states
Rare grassland bird spotted on river island near Guwahati," Leons Mathew Abraham of Kerala, who is studying at the College of Veterinary Sciences here, had a special Christmas gift this year as the sweet singing of a rare bird delighted his auditory senses and the winged wonder flitted in and out of his vision soon after.
A bird enthusiast, Leons travels extensively and has the knack of judging if a place is good enough for birding or not. He has visited the sars (river island) near Chandrapur area in Guwahati more than 10 times now.
On December 24, he luckily spotted a Laticilla cinerascens, or swamp prinia or swamp grass-babbler, one of the most endangered grassland birds in India, in the area.

“It’s really hard to spot them. Once I began visiting the sar in the evening, their songs were heard all over. I somehow managed to hide and try my luck. A bird began singing from the tussocks (tufts of long grass) a few metres away from me. I managed to shoot a video and click two photographs before it disappeared into the tussocks,” he said, adding that the swamp prinia is a very difficult species to spot.
“I was awestruck and I stopped my birding session to get back to my room and confirm whether it was the bird. After consulting others and doing some research on it, I was pretty sure about it. I felt really happy but at the same time quite sad since that habitat isn’t really good enough for the bird and their future on that island is bleak,” he said.

This species is specific to the Brahmaputra and Cachar plains. But all recent findings have been from a small pocket in Upper Assam and adjacent Arunachal Pradesh. The bird used to be found in the Dibru Saikhowa-Amarpur area but it went unrecorded for four years until it was found again in the D’Ering grasslands of Arunachal a few years ago.
“The Guwahati record is unexpected and significant as there has been no confirmed records outside the Dibru Saikhowa-Amarpur-D’Ering region for decades and there aren’t many suitable habitats around the city. That it was found in a seasonal river island hints that the species is prone to opportunistic movements along the Brahmaputra. It also shows the importance of conserving the river island ecosystem,” Assam birder Pritam Baruah said.",states
"Tourists litter 'lifeline' Bogibeel bridge, bikers perform stunts"," Dibrugrah resident Bhabesh Bailong, 62, who came to see the Bogibeel bridge as a tourist on Friday, was stunned to see it littered and ended up cleaning it himself.
“Bogibeel bridge is our lifeline and a million dreams are attached to it. Many of my friends left the world dreaming about the bridge. But they are fortunate because they did not live to witness the callousness of our people which I see today. It’s unbearable,” Bailong said while picking up chips packets, banana peels and bottles thrown by motorists and tourists visiting the bridge to cross the Brahmaputra by road.
Till December 25, before the inauguration of the bridge by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Dibrugarh and Dhemaji district administrations, along with railway personnel, ensured cleanliness by getting the bridge cleaned, painted and decorated with care and security.
After the inauguration, the rush of tourists has increased, with many reaching the spot for picnics.
The bridge is already tainted with betel nut and paan stains.
Bailong told The Telegraph, “The new generation which got it as a gift is not conscious about the hardships we faced in our life. To teach them a lesson and attract the attention of the administration, I am cleaning the garbage thrown by visitors and depositing them in isolated areas.”
Youths on bikes were seen performing stunts at full speed, causing a threat to the life of others. Since the commissioning of the bridge, many accidents have taken place with a child being run over by a vehicle on Friday.
Bogibeel bridge, the fifth bridge over the Brahmaputra, linking Dhemaji and Dibrugarh districts of Upper Assam, needs attention of the administrations of both the districts to control these activities.
The Prime Minister addressed a mammoth gathering at Kareng Chapori in Dhemaji district on north bank of the river after dedicating the bridge to the nation. He said it was not only a bridge but a lifeline for the people of Assam and other northeastern states.
Modi said the 4.94-km bridge was not only going to spur the life and livelihood of millions of people from Assam and Arunachal Pradesh but also would be a boon to the country’s defence base.",states
King speaks up for Manipur polo ponies," Manipur’s titular king Leishemba Sanajaoba urged chief minister N. Biren Singh to keep his promise to preserve Manipur ponies and complete the Marjing polo complex in Imphal East at the earliest.
Sanajaoba said this during the men and women’s senior and junior boys polo tournament organised by the All Manipur Polo Association at Mapal Kangjeibung on Friday.
“The population of the pony is dwindling day by day without proper care and lack of grazing grounds. There is an urgent need to speed up the facilities at the earliest,” he said.
The Marjing polo complex is spread across 23 acres over the Marjing hills in Imphal East while the grazing ground is only about four acres.
Sanajaoba said, “The pony is an integral part of Manipur’s history. The ponies have served our forefathers during their battles some 2,000 years ago. They won the battles because of the ponies. So it is time for repayment.”
“We can at least give them a proper grazing ground. Mapal Kangjeibung (outer polo ground) has gained popularity around the globe because of these ponies. It is time for us to give genuine thought towards its preservation and upkeep,” he added.

Sonowal allays NRC fears in Barak," Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Saturday said the people of Barak Valley need not worry as their safety and security is the responsibility of the government, apparently dispelling fear and anxiety among citizens over the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
The names of over 19 lakh citizens were left out of the final NRC published on August 31, causing dissatisfaction and apprehension among various sections of people in the state.
Massive protests under the banner of the North East Linguistic and Ethnic Co-Ordination Committee were staged in the three districts of Barak Valley recently.
Sonowal was speaking at a programme held at Police Parade ground here on Saturday in connection with the state-level closing ceremony of Poshan Maah under Poshan Abhiyan and launching of the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme in Cachar district.
“There is no reason for the citizens of Barak Valley to worry. It is the government’s responsibility to ensure their safety and safeguard their rights and interests,” he said, as the crowd cheered.
Talking about the government’s vision for growth and development, Sonowal said the Barak Valley has a lot of potential and resources and is a vital part of the state.
“Mini-secretariat’s work has already started. Citizens here will be immensely benefited after the project gets completed. Various other initiatives will be taken for the valley’s all-round development in the days ahead,” he said.
Social welfare minister Pramila Rani Brahma said the government gives immense importance to women, their empowerment, growth and welfare.
“Educating women is a stepping-stone towards a strong and prosperous nation,” she said.
She heaped praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his efforts towards the welfare of women. Prevention of malnutrition among women is a remarkable move towards a better society, she added.
Silchar MP Rajdeep Roy said Modi’s Poshan Abhiyan initiative had created a revolution across the country. He said the male-female ratio was disproportionate over the past several years but the scenario improved substantially after the scheme was launched.
He said the country has a rich history and has witnessed women in highly esteemed positions like those of the President and the Prime Minister. “They (women) have proved themselves everywhere,” he said, encouraging a huge gathering of women, who had come to attend the event.
Silchar MLA Dilip Kumar Paul, Barkhola MLA Kishore Nath, Udharbond MLA Mihir Kanti Shome, former minister Kabindra Purkayastha, deputy Speaker Aminul Haque Laskar and Cachar deputy commissioner Laya Madduri attended the event.",states
Push to take sting off other viruses," Efforts are on to contain an outbreak of dengue even as the state grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Eight of Jharkhand's 24 districts are classified as dengue endemic zones: Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh, Giridih, Gumla, Pakur and Sahebganj.
Dr Shailesh Chaurasia, state mission director, National Health mission, in a directive on Friday, has instructed all the deputy commissioners (DCs) to initiate larval surveillance with special focus on density assessment of dengue larvae (Aedes vector) in urban areas at the earliest.
“Usually the larval surveillance is done across the state between July and November during the monsoon but since sanitising and door-to-door survey are being carried out as part of Covid-19 exercise and the state has already started witnessing pre-monsoon showers from this month, we have decided to bering forward the larval surveillance from May-end which will continue till November. The larval surveillance will be done jointly by civic bodies and the district health department,” said state entomologist Dr Sagya Singh.
Larval surveillance and control is a critical component of any effective integrated mosquito management programme. It eliminates mosquitoes before they become adults.
“Trained field technicians inspect known source of standing water and newly discovered standing water in house-to-house surveys and use standard dipping techniques to sample the water for the immature mosquitoes and undertake physical control (destruction or removal of water accumulation points) and chemical control (through spraying of larvicides),” said a source in the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) unit of Jharkhand.
Preeti Sudan, secretary in the Union health ministry, had on May 13 written to state principal health secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni, reminding of the need for a concerted effort along with work on Covid-19 to manage vector-borne diseases.
“We need to note that malaria and dengue tend to have cyclic patterns and show a trend to spike after 5-6 years and 2-3 years respectively. We have been fortunately witnessing a decline in malaria since 2015 and hence this year (2020) may be critical in the given cyclic trend. We need to prepare for effective prevention and control of various vector borne diseases throughout the country,” the Union health secretary's letter said.
It had directed for surveillance against vector-borne diseases to be combined with Covid-19 activities.
Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Limited (TSUIS), managing director Tarun Daga said they will make efforts to prevent dengue breeding spots in their command areas.
“We would also appeal to the people to cooperate to prevent water accumulation and also inform us about any such points,” Daga said. “It is extremely important that there is no outbreak of dengue as the hospitals are under pressure due to Covid-19.”",states
"11 fresh cases in Tripura, count 167"," Eleven persons in Tripura tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, taking the state’s positive cases to 167.
However, the state government is yet to find the source of the virus.
Chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, who also holds the health portfolio, tweeted, “625 samples have been tested for #COVID19 and among them 11 persons found #COVID19 POSITIVE. 7 people from 86-Bn BSF & 4 civilians from Churaibari Gate (2 drivers from other states, 2 people returned from Guwahati). All the POSITIVE patients are under proper medical care”.
The state now has 103 active cases while 64 patients have been discharged from hospital.
Law minister Ratan Lal Nath told the media in the evening that all the 11 new patients had been shifted to Saheed Bhagat Singh youth hostel, now a dedicated Covid care centre near here.
He said the seven BSF personnel who tested positive on Saturday had earlier tested negative. “On May 15, 10 BSF personnel of the 86th Battalion at the BSF headquarters in Ambassa in Dhalai district were found to have mild symptoms and when we took their samples, seven BSF personnel tested positive,” he said.
The maximum number of Covid-19 cases in the state has been found among the BSF personnel of 86th and 138th battalions in Ambassa subdivision.
Nath said among the four civilians who tested positive, two were truck drivers coming from Bengal with goods of ONGC Tripura asset. The other two are a 20-year-old girl from Teliamura subdivision in Khowai district and a 24-year-old man from Kamalpur in Dhalai district. They came from Guwahati and Tezpur in Assam.
“These four civilians, who came to the state on May 14, were put under home quarantine after collecting their samples,” Nath said.
A three-member team, led by Dr G.K. Medhi, professor and head of the community medicine department at NEIGRIHMS, Shillong, which is visiting the state to assist the state health department on Covid-19 management, went to Dhalai district on Saturday, Nath said.",states
Party chief Golay does a Kejriwal," Taking a leaf out of the book of Aam Aadmi Party president Arvind Kejriwal, Sikkim Krantikari Morcha president P. S. Golay hosted a fund-raising dinner in a Gangtok hotel on Monday night for the cash-strapped party’s programmes in the lead up to the Assembly elections in the middle of next year.
A source in the SKM said the dinner was part of the party’s overall goal to usher in clean and transparent politics in the state. This is the first such event held by the SKM, which is the principal party opposed to the ruling Sikkim Democratic Party.
Golay, it is learnt, had formally invited between 80 to 100 people to the dinner, but double that number eventually turned up.
“There was no fixed cover charge for the dinner. The guests were asked to donate of their own free will. Not all the guests made the donation,” said the source.
The source, however, refused to reveal the amount of money collected at the dinner to protect the identity of the donors.
“The guests included people from all works of life, including government employees and contractors. We cannot for now reveal their names and the money collected in order to protect them from being targeted by the ruling dispensation,” said the source.
The Telegraph, however, could not independently establish the veracity of the SKM source’s claim. The dinner was a hush-hush affair and no media was invited.
In fact, the guests were also not allowed to take photographs on their mobile phones.
An intelligence source, however, confirmed that the event did take place in a hotel at Saath Mile.
The SKM source said the party was facing a fund crunch, which is why it had embarked on the exercise.
“We have a host of programmes lined up leading up to the Assembly elections next year. We need money - honest money - to organize those programmes. Unlike SDF, our party is not run under the influence of money-bags,” he said.
The major prorgammes of the party over the next couple of months include block-level tour of Golay beginning November 15 and a four-day youth convention to be held either in West Sikkim or South Sikkim in December.
The SKM had fared poorly in both the West and South districts in the 2014 Assembly elections, losing all the 16 seats to the SDF. In all, the party had won 10 out of the total 32 Assembly seats as against SDF’s 22. However, seven SKM legislators had later defected to the ruling party.",states
Yield of Darjeeling oranges dries up," Kishan Chhetri, an orange cultivator in the Darjeeling hills, used to send “two truckloads” of oranges to the plains until a few years ago. This year the farmer from Marybong, 25km from the town, does not expect his yield to be more than “two to three baskets”.
A truck can ferry around 30,000 oranges. Each basket holds around 200 oranges.
Orange growers across the Darjeeling hills have a similar story to tell, with production going down by more than 60 per cent compared to what it was five years ago.

Five years ago, the Darjeeling hills used to produce 2.59 lakh quintals a year of oranges, known for their distinctive sweetness and succulence. Last year, the yield fell to around 1 lakh quintals. This year, the produce is expected to be lower, capping a trend of gradual decline.
Viral and fungal infections, pest attacks and poor farming practices have been primarily blamed for the low yields.
Horticulture experts said even if concrete efforts were made it would take “at least five years” for the orange yield to improve.
Darjeeling oranges, though smaller in size, are considered superior to the Nagpur variety.
Madhav Chhetri, a senior scientist in the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration horticulture department, said: “The Darjeeling orange can be revived, but for that a massive exercise has to begin in earnest. To start with we have to set a target of distributing at least 5-6 lakh seedlings every year in the hills.”
Orange orchards in the hills are reeling from an assault of the citrus triststza virus, greening (fungal infections) and the trunk bore disease and an attack by fruit flies.
Getting seedlings is also a problem.
“The variety is grown only in the Darjeeling hills and Sikkim. So preparing seedlings is a problem as we cannot source them from outside. At the moment my department is distributing only 8,000 to 10,000 seedlings a year,” Madhav Chhetri said.
Lack of manpower has also been cited as one of the key reasons for the failure to produce adequate seedlings.
Madhav Chhetri said that even if corrective steps were taken from January next year it would take a minimum of five years “to increase the yield”, that too with a “sustained campaign”.
Lack of proper farming practices has also been blamed for the decreasing produce.
According to Madhav Chhetri, only two out of every 10 orange farmers are adopting proper agriculture practices, such a pest control and irrigation. He said community awareness was needed.
Samuel Rai, director of cinchona and other medicinal plants, said the orange yield was coming down every year.
“If we do not act immediately we will be left with nothing. We had a monopoly as this variety is grown only in Darjeeling, Sikkim and Bhutan. If we do not act fast everything will be lost,” he said.
Rai is drawing up an action plan along with the horticulture department. Officials, however, said “massive government support” would be needed.
Rai said awareness about good farming practices needed to be inculcated in school itself. “We are trying out various ways to attract farmers to our seminars and technique-teaching workshops,” he said.
Experts believe youths must be attracted to agriculture. “The UPA government had started a scheme called Attract Rural Youth in Agriculture. The scheme must be extended to the hills,” said Rai. The scheme offers incentives to farmers.
Officials said it was becoming more and more difficult to encourage hill farmers to grow oranges. “They are getting attracted to other cash crops (such as ginger and cardamom) after failing to deal with the poor orange yield,” another official said.
Orange traders in Siliguri are worried.
“The feedback from growers in the hills is that supply will be poor this year too. Of the hill sub-divisions, only Mirik is expected to supply a decent quantity of oranges,” said Palash Chakraborty, a member of the Siliguri Regulated Market Fruits and Vegetable Commission Agents Association.
Plucking of oranges has just started and will continue till January.

Medical camps at Chhath ghats in Bihar," Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi inspected Chhath ghats onboard a steamer on Tuesday and ordered officials to deploy ambulances and set up medical camps for devotees’ safety.
Accompanied by ministers and officials, Modi travelled from Nasriganj to Gaighat to check the riverbanks where scores of devotees will perform Chhath rituals next week. Urban development and housing minister Suresh Sharma said Modi directed officials concerned to ensure work at the ghats are completed well before the festival. Pehli Arghya, when devotees go to the banks to pay obeisance to the setting Sun, falls on November 13 this year.
Chhath will be performed at 92 ghats in the city and Sharma said adequate number of watchtowers will be set up to keep vigil while lakhs of devotees gather at the banks of river Ganga. “Adequate number of structures will be created for devotees who change their clothes at the ghats. Temporary toilets will also be set up,” said Sharma.
Besides deploying ambulances at the ghats and setting up temporary medical camps, Modi has directed the officials to depute NDRF and SDRF teams in motorboats and keep divers ready. He has directed that steps should be taken to dig temporary ponds on empty lands and in parks, so that some of the devotees can perform the rituals there.
The district administration and police have been directed to put in place security arrangements at the ghats and Patna roads ahead of the devotees reaching the banks. Minister Sharma said Modi directed the officials on making arrangements for making devotees aware of the dangerous ghats. Proper display boards should be placed at the ghats, he has ordered. “We have decided to come up with advertisements and details of dangerous ghats,” Sharma added. Road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav, public health and engineering minister Vinod Narayan Jha, Patna mayor Sita Sahu accompanied Modi on the inspection.
Jha assured Modi that his department will ensure pure drinking water is supplied at the ghats. Government departments and agencies besides the Patna Municipal Corporation are working in close co-ordination to ensure proper arrangements are in place.",states
"Hundreds of years later, diyas light up Pala temple in Bihar"," When a bunch of students and members of a volunteer organisation lit lamps on Octo ber 30 at the ruins of the Lakshadeep temple in the Mandar hill area of Banka district around 281 km south-east of Patna, they were trying to revive a tradition hundreds of years old. The temple used to be lit up with one lakh diyas during the time of the Pala dynasty from the 8th to the 12th century.
The students, from the postgraduate department of ancient Indian history, culture and archaeology at the Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU), and the organisation members were also giving expression to the demand to revive such historical temples and ruins.
The varsity department has approached former Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) director Mohammad KK for renovation of such ruined temples.
According to Behari Lal Choudhary, head of history department at TMBU, senior history teacher Raman Sinha, and former deputy director in the state's public relation department Shivshanker Singh Parijat approached Md K.K. when visited Bhagalpur recently. “KK saheb sought documents and photographs of the temples in their present form,” Choudhary said.
On October 30, staff from the history department of SM College in Bhagalpur and members of the Mandar Vikash Parisad also conducted a cleanliness drive in the Mandar hill area. They cleared bushes that had grown at the temple and decorated it with Manjusha art.

Bhagalpur zone deputy inspector-general of police (DIG) Vikash Vaibhav, who was the chief guest, stressed on the need for such initiatives to revive the area's past. 'Mandar holds a place in Hindu mythology and was also an important Buddhist centre during the Pala era,' he said.
Parijat said queen Kona Devi from the Chola dynasty in south India had contracted a skin disease of which she was cured after taking bath in the Papharani, a tank on the foothills of the Mandar hill. Earlier, the tank was surrounded by medicinal plants.

Tourism daily loss Rs 19 crore in north Bengal and Sikkim," Stakeholders of tourism industry who conducted a survey in north Bengal and Sikkim to assess the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the nationwide lockdown have estimated a daily loss of Rs 19 crore.
According to them, the industry in the region has already suffered a loss of around 1,000 crore which is likely to go up further if the same situation persists in the coming weeks.
Sources said the north Bengal zonal council of the Confederation of Tourism Industry, Association for Conservation and Tourism, the Himalayan Hospitality and Tourism Development Network and some other associations in the region had conducted the survey.
They have collated the data and come up with some recommendations which would be sent to the central and state governments. On April 29, the Union tourism ministry had constituted the National Tourism Task Force for the revival of the industry. The details would also be sent to the force, said a tour operator.

College hard-sells location in green zone," A private engineering college of Bankura is trying to attract students, riding on its location within a “green” zone on Bengal’s Covid map.
A district is labelled “green” if it reports no new infections for 21 days and Bankura is among the five Bengal districts on that list currently.
Although the status is impermanent in nature, Bankura Unnayani Institute of Engineering has tried to cash in.
“We have to live with corona in the ensuing days and prospective guardians must consider admitting their wards in a college situated in a green zone and remain free of worry,” reads a print advertisement released by the institute.
Sasanka Dutta, the chairman of the college, told Metro over the phone that at a time when places like Calcutta have multiple hotspots, it would be safer for parents to admit their wards to a college 218km away from the city. He stressed how thinly populated the area around the college was and “so full of greenery”.
“I don’t think guardians would find institutes in and around Calcutta a safe option to admit their children in the wake of a pandemic that is likely to stay. They should come to our campus. We are in the green zone. We offer good placements,” said Dutta.
Any other time, placements would have topped the list of benefits offered.
Marketing professionals and ad men loved his pitch.
“They have made a claim that could immediately strike a chord with prospective parents ahead of the admission season,” said Kanchan Datta of Inner Circle Advertising.
He suggested that the college could take the pitch further and promise ahead of others that it would strictly abide by the physical distancing norms within the classrooms, canteens and hostels.“For the immediate, they opted for a more sensational spin,” added Datta.
A marketing professional said the text was also trying to drive home the point that institutes in less populated zones were a safer option to pursue studies during a raging pandemic. “Corona is perceived by many to be an urban outbreak. The language of the advertisement has sought to play on this sentiment,” he said.
But the green label could be short-lived, warned a health official. If a case is reported in a “green” zone, it immediately gets converted into an “orange” zone.
Sabyasachi Sengupta, former vice-chancellor of the state tech university to which the college is affiliated, said the advertisement gave a signal of things to come.
“As the days progress, colleges would compete to draw students based on how many Covid-19 cases are reported from that area. It is hard to imagine that a district would remain a ‘green’ zone forever,” said Sengupta.",states
Apartments clock more Covid-19 cases than slums in Calcutta," More Covid-19 cases are now being reported from “buildings” than slums, Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, said on Friday.
A civic official said the mayor meant apartments and standalone houses by “buildings”.
Hakim said about 30-40 cases were being reported from the city every day and a majority of them were from buildings. “The change has been apparent over the past seven or 10 days,” a CMC official said.
Even a couple of weeks ago, most new cases were reported from slums, indicating that the coronavirus was spreading there because of the high density of population.
The trend has changed over the past week or so across the city, officials said.
The health department’s bulletin issued on Friday said 1,200 Covid-19 cases had been reported from Calcutta, 43 of them over the last 24 hours.
“It is difficult to say how people living in standalone buildings and apartments are contracting the virus,” an official said.
Hakim also said on Friday that the CMC had decided that if a case was reported from an apartment complex, only that complex would be turned into a containment zone and not the entire neighbourhood.
The number of containment zones has come down to 286 in Calcutta. The Belgachhia slum and Rajabazar have been taken off the list, he said. CMC sources said no new cases were reported from these places over the past three weeks.
There were 340 containment zones in Calcutta on May 11, the last time the list was published on the Calcutta police Facebook page.
CMC officials said one reason for the drop in the number of containment zones was that in some places two adjacent zones had been merged.
“This will benefit surveillance and screening. Earlier, the people living between two containment zones were not screened stringently. Now, they will be because they come under a containment zone,” said an official.

Encroacher sells off government land," Illegal construction has begun on a considerable stretch of government land along the Kharkai river in Adityapur in adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district, around 2km from Bistupur, at a time when the administrative machinery is occupied with the Assembly elections.
The stretch of land where construction activities are on in full swing is located along the Radhaswami Temple Road that connects Road No. 32 in Adityapur.
Gomia Biruli, 45, a resident of Kuluptanga in Adityapur, is selling plots of land at Rs 400 per square feet.
In government records, the land measuring 2.5 acres has been earmarked as “encroached land” where crops can be grown, but construction activities are forbidden.
Shyam Biruli, a resident of Kuluptanga, said Gomia’s forefathers had encroached upon the land decades ago and a survey conducted in 1964 had marked it as “encroached land”.
He also produced a document supporting his claim.
A senior official at the circle office in Gamharia, under which Kuluptanga and the government land in question falls, said: “It is illegal to undertake construction on encroached government land. One can engage in cultivation, but construction is strictly prohibited.”
Diwakar Prasad, another resident of Kuluptanga, said Gomia started levelling the land, on which he had been growing crops till 2016, soon after the model code of conduct kicked in.
“Within two-three days, the land was ready to be sold as plots for building houses,” he said.
Diwakar said Gomia had engaged middlemen to contact buyers and was making big bucks by selling the plots for Rs 400 per square feet.
Bablu Biruli, one of the agents of Gomia, confirmed the development.
“The plots adjoining the road have already been sold. The plots in the second row are alsoup for sale. Anyone can buy them,” Bablu said.
Seraikela-Kharsawan deputy commissioner A. Dodde said he would get the matter investigated and take necessary action immediately.
“We will demolish the unauthorised construction. The ongoing election won’t come in the way of enforcing the law,” Dodde said.",states
Move to help sandbar people file claims for place in Assam NRC," A lower Assam-based citizen and constitutional collective on Thursday launched an awareness campaign among people dwelling on the fringes, including sars (sandbars) and riverine areas, in Barpeta district on the December 31 deadline to file claims for inclusion in the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
Sambidhan Sevak is an initiative of human rights activist and former National Human Rights Commission monitor for minorities Harsh Mander. Under this initiative, local youths are being taught about the Constitution and the citizenship rights it guarantees, and spreads awareness about it among the people living in remote and vulnerable places.
Sambidhan Sevak volunteers have embarked on a door-to-door loudspeaker campaign to alert people on filing of claims. Two teams are moving in autorickshaws fitted with loudspeakers and stopping at village chowks and marketplaces, urging people to come out and file their claims before the December 31 deadline. They have also set up help desks near the NRC seva kendras (NSK) where volunteers are helping the unlettered fill up their claims forms. On Thursday, the volunteers visited Pahari, Chenibari, Padmapara, Chata, Khongra, Parghat, Pahari Parghat, Shila, Kakphuwa, Rowmari, Ganakpara and other places in Barpeta district. Some of these places are near sars and riverine areas, from where inhabitants come for daily trade and other work.
The team said they found out that there are nearly 1,500 people in the places they visited who have not filed their claims owing to a lack of understanding of the process, failure to provide legacy linkage, technical error and other reasons. The team said besides informing about the deadline, they are also trying to bridge the gap in filing of claims by providing the best possible help.
“The state government should have initiated such measures so that the poor and the illiterate don’t fail to file their claims. We are conducting this campaign as our responsibility to the civil society. The NRC is a state exercise and it is quite important to determine citizenship as genuine citizens shouldn’t get left out. We have embarked on this tour to alert the people to come out and file their claims as soon as possible. We are aiming to cover thousands in the next few days,” said team member Ashraful Hussain.
“Some of the areas where we visited serve as a transit point for people travelling to and from sars. It is the perfect place to alert people about the approaching deadline and to address some of their queries,” he said.
Sambidhan Sevak comprises writers, independent researchers, local journalists, civil society members and other people from different communities in Barpeta district.",states
"Ranchi cops crack kidnap, 2 murders in a day"," It was a day of rare success for Ranchi police who not only rescued a kidnapped seven-year-old, but also cracked two murder cases, one each registered at Tupudana and Sukhdeonagar police stations.
Son of a Hindustan Petroleum contractor, Krishna Mishra was whisked away from a playground near his house in Ganganagar under Sukhdeonagar thana on December 24 evening. He was found sleeping on a hay stack near Chituadag Prathmik Vidyalaya in Tupudana, 20km from city, on Thursday morning.
Police have arrested three kidnappers. While Shivanand Oraon and Rajesh Kumar Tudu were also in deep slumber beside the child, their accomplice Anil Kumar Lakra was arrested from a nearby area. All are in their twenties.
Ranchi SSP Anish Gupta said the motive behind the kidnapping was ransom. “One of the kidnappers, Shivanand Oraon, was an old employee of the boy’s father. He lured the child with a cycle ride. They kept on changing locations and managed to give ransom calls with the help of others. The demand was Rs 40 lakh for the safe return of the boy. The money was to be delivered by Friday,” Gupta told reporters at his office on Thursday evening.
One motorbike, a loaded countrymade firearm, five SIM cards and three mobile phones were recovered from the trio.

Amit Shah to hold meet today," The Union home ministry has invited the Manipur People Against Citizenship Amendment Bill (MANPAC) and different political parties active in the state for consultation on Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on Tuesday, chief minister N. Biren Singh said.
Talking on the sidelines of launching Matru Vandana Saptah, a weeklong maternity benefit programme taken up under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, at his secretariat on Monday, Biren Singh said Union home minister Amit Shah would meet the delegates from the state in New Delhi on Tuesday at 10.30pm.
The state government has also sent the intimation letters to MANPAC and the political parties.
The organisation did not participate in the stakeholders’ meeting held with Shah as it did not get the intimation letter from the home ministry office.
On Sunday, MANPAC held a meeting of 88 consultant partners at Amuco office where they resolved to oppose the bill tooth and nail if it was passed in Parliament.
On Sunday evening MANPAC representatives, led by its convener Yumnamcha Dilipkumar, met Biren Singh at his secretariat and informed him about their resolution.

AASU bike rally in Udalguri,"  The All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and allied organisations took out a motorcycle rally at Tangla town in Udalguri district of Assam on Monday in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill which the Centre has listed for passage in the winter session of Parliament.
More than one hundred motorcycles were part of the motorcade taken out by the Tangla unit of AASU, All Rabha Students’ Union and All Assam Sarania Kachari Students’ Union. It started from Tangla HS School playground, passed through the main thoroughfares of Tangla town and culminated at Tangla Charali.
The protesters raised slogans and burnt effigies symbolising the BJP and the party’s allies in the Assam government, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF). Addressing the gathering, AASU’s Tangla unit president Pranjal Deka and the union’s central committee assistant general secretary Jayanta Kumar Bhattacharjya said the bill was an attempt to destroy the identity of the indigenous people of the state.
“The bill is a threat to our state and the region. We oppose it tooth and nail and exhort the government to withdraw it immediately,” Bhattacharjya said.
“The present BJP government, before coming to power, had promised to oust illegal foreigners irrespective of religion. It has now changed its tune and is attempting to extend citizenship beyond the cut-off date of March 24, 1971, which is not acceptable because Assam is already overburdened with immigrants from Bangladesh, causing serious economic and social stress and an identity crisis that threatens the existence of the indigenous communities of Assam,” he added.
Deka said, “We dare the government to bring the bill in Assam. It will see a turmoil of a much larger intensity and magnitude than the Assam Movement during which 855 martyrs sacrificed their lives.”",states
Will waive farm loans if we come to power: Rahul," Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday promised to waive farm loans if the Opposition coalition comes to power in Jharkhand and vowed to change the state, which has a significant tribal population, just like neighbouring Chhattisgarh where his party stormed to power last year.
Addressing a poll rally here, Rahul said that within a year of coming to power, the Congress government had changed the scenario in Chhattisgarh.
“You (the tribals) have land, forests and water, we are there to protect them,” he said.
Rahul said the BJP government in Chhattisgarh “snatched” lands of tribals and gave it to industrialists, but the Congress government had returned their lands.
“Wherever we promised to waive farm loans, we did so after coming to power. In Jharkhand as well, we will do the same if our coalition is voted to power,” Rahul added.
The Congress is contesting 31 seats in the Assembly elections. The next date of polling in the five-phase elections is December 7.
The Congress is allied with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Rashtriya Janata Dal for the elections. The BJP, on the other hand, is with the Ajsu Party and the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha.",states
Jadavpur University shelves domicile quota plan," Jadavpur University has shelved a proposal to introduce a domicile quota for engineering, taking heed of vice-chancellor Suranjan Das’s argument that a campus aspiring to the tag of “institute of eminence” should not be shutting the door on deserving students in the name of reservation.
The Faculty Council for Engineering and Technology had on December 18 sought the opinions of each department on the proposed domicile quota within seven days.
A council member said vice-chancellor Das, who is nearing the end of his tenure, had reservations about a top university blocking out outstation students to ensure that domiciled candidates got some seats.

Das confirmed taking a stand against the proposal when Metro contacted him on Tuesday. “The proposal needs to be deliberated in detail before we take a call on implementing it. It’s a major policy decision,” he said.
Chiranjeeb Bhattacharya, the dean of engineering, said the proposal had been kept in abeyance but would not reveal what prompted the rethink. “We are not going to implement the proposal next year,” he said.
The pitch for a domicile quota had come at a meeting of the faculty council. The rationale for reservation was that students from Bengal had been outnumbered by candidates from elsewhere in the engineering classrooms.
Sources said vice-chancellor Das warned that any such step could scupper Jadavpur University’s bid to get UGC recognition as an institute of eminence, a tag that will bring with it central funding on a scale the campus has not seen before.
Jadavpur University is No. 7 on a shortlist of eight “public institutions” drawn up by an empowered expert committee. The UGC picked three from the list on July 9 and gave an assurance that the rest “shall be considered at a later stage”.
If and when it makes the cut, Jadavpur University will receive Rs 1,000 crore in grants over five years.
An engineering professor backed vice-chancellor Das’s stand, saying that a domicile quota would erode the institute’s regional diversity, one of the rating sub-parameters of the human resource development ministry.
Regional diversity is an extension of a university’s outreach and inclusiveness and is assessed looking at the percentage of students from other states and/or countries studying in that institute.
The other parameters include utilisation of funds and peer perception.
Jadavpur University had fared poorly in an assessment of regional diversity, reflected in the rankings published in April. The institute was ranked among the top 13 institutes overall, but scored 0.33 out of 3 in regional diversity.
“The university gets students from other states because of its engineering courses. If a domicile quota were to be implemented, regional diversity will be further impacted. This could impact our ranking,” the professor said.
In the April rankings, Jadavpur University was down compared to the previous year across the three categories —overall (12 to 13), university (6 to 12) and engineering (5 to 9).
Fifty-one of the 71 general-category seats in civil engineering were taken by students from outside Bengal this year. In chemical engineering, the ratio was 24 to 57.",states
Mujnai is 2nd tea garden in Dooars to close," The management of the Mujnai Tea Estate in Alipurduar has announced suspension of work at the garden.
This is the second garden in the Dooars to close down in the past 24 hours.
On Tuesday morning, the management of Chengmari Tea Estate had announced suspension of work following demonstrations by a section of workers and alleged assault on the manager on Monday. Due to the closure, around 6,000 people had become jobless and on Wednesday, another 1,000 workers of Mujnai faced the same crisis.
In the notice that the Mujnai management has served in the garden, a number of reasons have been mentioned, which sources said, have led to the decision.
“On Tuesday, an assistant manager had asked some workers to carry out pruning in a plantation but they refused. Some had threatened the managerial staff. This is one of the reasons which made the management take the decision, said S. Guha Thakurata, secretary, Dooars Branch of Indian Tea Association.
According to garden sources, after serving the notice, all the managerial staff had left the garden by late Wednesday evening.
The workers however, are not ready to buy the theory and said that was some misunderstanding over work. Union leaders have also blamed the management.
“There was a misunderstanding between workers and some managerial staff at the garden. The management however, exaggerated it and took the opportunity to announce suspension of work as production,” said Mannalal Jain, a leader of Bagan Trinamul Congress Mazdoor Union.
“We have come to know about the Mujnai Tea Estate. A tripartite meeting will be convened immediately to reopen the garden,” said Chandan Dasgupta, joint labour commissioner, Siliguri. ",states
Chandernagore friends give succour to needy," Two women have come together in Hooghly’s Chandernagore to provide monthly rations to seven underprivileged families and everyday necessaries to 25 school going children.
Moumita Chatterjee, 23, and Joyasri Jana, 25, are college graduates and friends who resolved to help needy families in their home area of Subhas Pally in Chandernagore.
“Sometime two years ago, Jayasri and I were sitting idle. We began discussing the plight of slum children and how we wanted to help them,” said Moumita, who lives with her widowed mother and two brothers and earns around Rs 3,000 a month through tuitions.
Long time friends and neighbours, the duo began putting their personal earnings from private tuitions into the charity drive, alongside preparations for the administrative service examinations. “Back then, we started helping six students fully from our own income,” she added.
Two years on, and aided by their income as well as cash and donations from will-wishers in the area, the duo provide for 25 schoolchildren from different areas of the district in a welfare programme titled ‘5 takar ration’. Alongside, they meet the monthly ration needs of seven families free of cost.
“Five rupees is not the issue as the kit we are providing to the school children costs more than Rs 300,” said Joyasri, referring to the 12 kit hamper comprising notebooks, pens, pencils, colour box, health drinks and biscuits. “We want to see them excel in school.”
According to the duo, they didn’t want their intention to help families to be perceived as sympathy. “We take Rs 5 from the children’s families so that they feel they are a part of this and they don’t think that they are the recipients of sympathy,” Joyasri added.
In late 2017, the friends set up a Facebook page titled Srishti Foundation, which has since garnered over 1,000 followers from the area. The duo said it was part of an outreach effort to let people in the area know about their personal initiative.
“We began to post a list of the items that we were providing to families,” said Moumita.
“Soon after that, many people stepped forward to contribute towards our efforts. We received an excellent response,” she added.
Aside from their campaign for schoolchildren, Moumita and Jayasri scanned Hooghly’s Singur, Telenipara and Bhadreswar over the past one year to list seven needy families to whom they would provide full monthly rations free of cost. In the monthly ration, they provide 10 kg of rice, 1kg of pulses, mustard oil, flour, sugar, tea leaves, sattu, suji, vegetables, detergent powder, tooth paste, soaps, shampoo, hair oil and spices.
“There is a couple from Hooghly where the husband became paralysed recently and the wife is blind. They can’t even leave home. There is also an 82-year-old lady who used to sell papad. We feel happy with our work,” said Moumita.",states
A rally driven by causes," They drove for a cause. One team drove to break menstruation taboos, another fairness myths and yet another protested attacks on doctors.
They rallied through the streets of Calcutta, solving crossword puzzles and fitting jigsaw pieces to hunt for treasure. All this and more were on Sunday’s to-do list for the 85-odd participants of Wonder on Wheels, in association with The Telegraph.
The women’s car rally was flagged off at Quest mall at 7.30am on Sunday by Raveendran Sankaran, IPS, inspector general, Central Reserve Police Force, West Bengal circle, and the chief guest for the occasion. This was the third edition of Wonder on Wheels organised by Calcutta Park Street Ladies Circle 46 and Calcutta Park Street Roundtable 34.
“This was a fundraiser. The entire proceeds from the event will go towards education of underprivileged children,” said Ruchi Agarwal, the chairperson of Calcutta Park Street Ladies Circle 46.
Eighty-five cars, each of which had at least one woman member either at the wheel or as navigator, took part in a Time-Speed-Distance (TSD) rally that ran from Quest mall through Salt Lake to Handloom Cottage, Kankurgachhi.

“The rally covered 30km and then the treasure hunt started. The participants were given crossword and picture clues and jigsaw puzzles as clues. They had to solve them to reach the destinations for the treasure hunt. The hunt took them to Columbia Asia Hospital, GST Bhavan, Birla Mandir and Carnival cinema,” Agarwal sadi.
All the cars returned to Quest mall at the end of the rally-cum-treasure hunt with a total run of 55km.
The participants showcased their causes with their attire. “Each team had a cause, and were dressed for it. Like the team that sought to break myths about fairness had shades of black on their faces,” Agarwal said.
A doctor duo appealing against attacks on medical professionals had bandages wrapped around their heads and stethoscopes around their necks. Their message: “We serve you, so please don’t hurt us.”",states
Bar on Bistupur traffic for PM rally," Traffic in and around Bistupur will be restricted on Tuesday for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s election rally at Gopal Maidan.
According to the directive of East Singhbhum district administration, the entry of heavy vehicles into the city will be barred from 6am to 3pm on Tuesday.
Gopal Maidan, from where Modi will address the rally at 11am, has already become a high security zone. All the three roads encircling the venue will be blocked for commuters.
The road from the roundabout near Tata Main Hospital to the roundabout near Voltas House in Bistupur will be open to traffic. However, Bistupur-Kadma Road via Centre Point Hotel and Outer Circle Road will be partially blocked, triggerring traffic hassles.
“All the routes surrounding the Gopal Maidan will be more or less blocked for security reasons. Only Bistupur Main Road will witness smooth vehicular movement. People will have to find an alternative route at least till the departure of the Prime Minister,” deputy superintendent of police (traffic) Shivendra Kumar said.

Private schools in Bistupur may remain closed on Tuesday because commuting will become problematic for students.
There are around five schools and two colleges in the vicinity of Gopal Maidan.
“We realise that there will be a problem for students. Therefore, we will be taking a decision by tomorrow (Monday). We will also ask what other nearby schools will be doing,” a faculty member of Narbheram Hansraj English School, located close to Gopal Maidan, said.",states
Child abuse worry in Assam," Assam has the second highest cases of child torture in the country, after Madhya Pradesh.
A report was released on Tuesday by the National Campaign Against Torture (NCAT) in New Delhi which said 96 children are tortured and sexually assaulted every day in India. Over four lakh children residing in child- care institutions (CCIs), the dens of torture and sexual abuse, remain at high risk.
The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in its Crime in India 2017 report, recorded torture of 4,857 children and sexual assault of 30,123 children during the year, a total of 34,980 victims or about 96 children being victimised every day.
“That the NCRB for the first time reported cases of torture of children including by police under Sections 330 and 331 of the Indian Penal Code in its Crime in India 2017 is welcome,” said Suhas Chakma, coordinator of the NCAT.
In 2017, the highest number of cases of torture of children was reported from Madhya Pradesh (1,638 victims) followed by Assam (1,127), Maharashtra (377), Chhattisgarh (370), West Bengal (247), Uttar Pradesh (244), Tamil Nadu (179), Kerala (178), Andhra Pradesh (120) and Delhi (97), among others.
“In Assam, during 2017, a total of 1,127 children, that is three children per day, were subjected to torture in 483 cases, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. A total of 3,099 children were staying in 131 child-care institutions who were at high risks of torture and abuse,” said Chakma. “Though Section 10(1) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 specifically states that in no case a child alleged to be in conflict with law shall be placed in a police lockup or lodged in a jail, in reality children are still detained in police lockup regularly and tortured to extract confessions.”
“The juvenile justice act does not use the term torture while the torture of children, including by the police, is routine across India and the data is being currently being recorded by the NCRB,” said Chakma.
The NCAT urged the Centre to amend the Juvenile Justice Act to prohibit torture of children as defined under Article 1 of the UN Convention against Torture (UNCAT), ratify the UNCAT and bring a standalone national law against torture.
There are 718 districts in India, but according to the latest data, as on August 3, 2018, India had only 301 observation homes, 31 special homes, 21 observation-cum-special homes and nine place of safety. It implies that 396 districts do not have observation homes, 666 districts do not have special homes and 709 districts do not have any place of safety to house juveniles in conflict with law.
Citing the case of Arunachal Pradesh, the NCAT said, “The Centre had provided Rs 116.99 lakh during 2014-15 and Rs 253.49 lakh during 2015-16 to the Arunachal Pradesh government for construction of two observation and special homes. But the state government constructed only one observation-cum-special home meant to house juveniles from 25 districts.”",states
"In Birbhum, footballers lose, but win hearts"," A football team had just lost a match. But many around the field clapped for them on Saturday afternoon.
The applause was for a bunch of girls from Birbhum who had to apparently brave abuse and assault to keep their boots on.
The team from Mallarpur, a Birbhum pocket around 200km from Calcutta, lost in the pre-quarter final of an under-18 five-a-side tournament in Calcutta on Saturday.
On November 5, a group of 30 men stormed the ground in Garia village where these girls were playing football, practising for the tournament, an NGO official accompanying the team alleged.
The girls live at a home run by the NGO, Uthnau, in the village. The mob demanded they stop playing football. Whey they refused, they were kicked, punched and slapped, the official claimed

The girls, aged between 13 and 16, tried their best to fend off the attackers but were outnumbered. The NGO shelter, too, was ransacked.
“I was slapped in the face and kicked so hard that I could not sleep properly for the next few days,” Didimani Baske, 16, said.
Arpita Murmu, 14, said she had a swollen wrist.
The mob included the local panchayat chief, Sonamoni Murmu, the NGO official who is the supervisor of the home, alleged.
Panchayat chief Dilip Kisku told Metro: “I was not present there. I don’t know of any violence.
“The girls are from neighbouring villages. Girls in our village don’t play football.”
The block development officer (BDO) of Rampurhat I, in whose jurisdiction the village falls, said: “I have not received any such report. I will have to check.”
The tournament that hosted this team is unique. It has been billed as the first mixed gender football tournament in the city.
Each team has three girls and two boys playing and a girl and a boy in the reserve. The mixed-gender tournament aims to bridge the gender divide in society, Richa Daga of Fun Pickle, the organisers of the tournament, said.
The matches are being played on the synthetic turf of the Punjab Club ground on Ballygunge Circular Road.
Several nuggets emerged from more than 20 outstation teams that had turned up, like the Manipur team members who saw a train for the first time while on their way to Calcutta.
But the indomitable spirit of the Birbhum girls seemed unparalleled.
“The men would visit our parents and threaten them,” Sihwanti Hansda, 15, said. “But I like playing football. I want to represent my country and not work as a labourer.”
Most of the villages in the vicinity are poor. Villagers work on the fields and work as daily labourers at stone crushing units in the off-season. The children are mostly first generation learners and many even work at the quarries.
Kunal Deb, the man behind the NGO, said: “These men are against female empowerment.... The girls are often made to work at the quarries. They refuse to work as daily labourers after getting more exposure. That would hurt the pockets of these men who take money from the quarry owners.”",states

Date drive turns fatal on Bengal's Nadia highway," A young businessman and his fiancée who were engaged two months ago and planned to marry next year died after their car rammed into the back of a stationary bus on a highway in Nadia’s Ranaghat late on Friday night.
Sajal Acharya, 26, and Rama Adhikary, 21, were driving back home to Ranaghat from an evening date when their car smashed into the bus at Habibpur crossing on National Highway 12, leaving the Hyundai mangled beyond recognition.
Acharya died on the spot and Adhikary at the Ranaghat Sub-divisional Hospital. Acharya was a dealer in used cars and Adhikary a BA second-year student.
Residents and family members blamed police for the accident, alleging inaction in curbing the menace of drivers parking vehicles on the edge of the highways without switching on emergency lights. They said such lapses had resulted in many fatal accidents, more so during fog in winter. “Visibility was poor on Friday night because of fog,” said a shop-owner near the site.
Acharya’s mother Preeti blamed the bus. “I have heard the bus was standing by the side of the road and had no lights on. These things have been happening too frequently. Our loss is irreparable,” Preeti said.
A Ranaghat police officer claimed speeding led to the crash. “The deceased was driving at very high speed and lost control trying to overtake a truck. It couldn’t be ascertained if the emergency lights of the bus were on,” the officer said.
Residents alleged that a large number of vehicles, particularly trucks, park dangerously while their drivers step into dhabas along the highway.",states
Debate over Bogibeel bridge’s name," A debate over the naming of Bogibeel bridge continues weeks before its inauguration by Prime minister Narendra Modi on December 25. The indigenous organisations of Assam are demanding that the bridge be named after their preferred personalities.
The All Assam Chutia Students’ Union (AACSU) has recently demanded that the bridge be named after Chutia dynasty queen Sati Sadhani. The union threatened that 100 youths of the community would jump into the Brahmaputra from the Bogibeel bridge on the day of its inauguration if the government did not name it after Sati Sadhani.
The Dibrugarh district unit of the All Assam Ahom Sabha has demanded that the bridge be named after founder of the erstwhile Ahom kingdom Chaolung Siu-ka-pha.
In a memorandum to Modi, the organisation stated that the bridge should be named after Siu-ka-pha, “the founder of bor Axom (greater Assam) and Axomiya society”.
Describing Siu-ka-pha as the epitome of India’s historical links with Southeast Asia, the statement says: “It would be significant to leverage this linkage towards realisation of the objectives of India’s Act East policy’’.
Modi will inaugurate the longest rail-cum-road bridge on December 25, the birth anniversary of late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
A section of BJP leaders, including Dibrugarh MLA Prasanta Phukan, are in favour of naming the bridge “Atal Setu”.
Recently, leader of the banned Ulfa (I) Paresh Barua said the bridge should be named after Bishnu Prasad Rabha and Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, two eminent personalities from Assam, as Bishnu-Jyoti Bridge.
Speaking to a local news channel, Barua said Assam should support the idea and India’s longest rail-cum-road bridge should be named after literary luminaries of Assam.
Talking to this correspondent, AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said: “Bogibeel bridge should be named after eminent personalities of Assam. We have lots of legendary figures in Assam; so we urge the government to immediately sort out the issue and name the bridge after the legendary figures of Assam without hurting the sentiments of any community.”
Everybody is eagerly awaiting the inauguration of the bridge because it will ease a communication bottleneck of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The project cost has escalated from Rs 1,767 crore to Rs 5,800 crore, given multiple deadline revisions. The multi-crore rupee bridge has earned the unflattering tag of the slowest moving infrastructure project of the region.
According to residents of Dibrugarh, the name should be “Bogibeel bridge”.
“We have waited for 17 years for the completion of the bridge. The name should not change,” Ananta Mohan, a local resident of Dibrugarh, said.
Nabajyoti Borkakoti, a social activist of Dibrugarh, said the bridge should be named after Dr John Berry White, “an Assamese by heart and a doyen of industrial development, rail and road communication in erstwhile Assam.” ",states
Ceasework in colleges today," Classes in over 500 colleges and at least six universities could be affected on Tuesday as teachers have called a ceasework to protest the government’s decision to hike salaries from January 2020 instead of January 2016.
The West Bengal College and University Teachers’ Association (WBCUTA) has given the ceasework call and approximately 10,000 teachers will take part in the protest, said a member of the teachers’ body.
Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on November 5 had announced that college and university teachers would be paid according to the seventh central pay commission’s recommendations from January next year instead of January 2016.
Keshab Bhattacharya, general secretary of the Left-backed teachers’ body, said they were forced to call the ceasework because their appeal to the state government to implement the revised pay scale from January 2016 had fallen on deaf ears.
The Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association will observe the ceasework both on November 19 and 20. “An assistant professor (at the starting level) would miss out on Rs 6.4 lakh for four years,” said Partha Pratim Ray, the general secretary of the association.
Repeated calls to education minister Partha Chatterjee went unanswered. He did not respond to the text messages either.
Omprakash Mishra, a leader of the Trinamul Congress who teaches at JU, called the protest unfair.
“Under the circumstances, the chief minister has put her best foot forward. She explained given the financial situation, she could not do more at this moment. The teachers should have realised her compulsion,” said Mishra, who recently joined Trinamul.",states
Ampareen calls for all-party meeting," Meghalaya Congress legislator M. Ampareen Lyngdoh has urged the Conrad K. Sangma government to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which the BJP government at the Centre intends to table during the ongoing winter session of Parliament.
“We are finally coming to terms with the fact that with the session that is currently being held in Parliament, the bill will be a major agenda,” Ampareen told reporters here on Monday.
The bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, in order to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to escape religious persecution and entered India before December 31, 2014.
“I think it would be correct for us to suggest that the Meghalaya government immediately call an all-party meeting. I feel we need to ensure that the voice against the bill is unanimous and that we ensure that the peace that we have been enjoying in the state does not suffer a setback,” the legislator said.
She said the Meghalaya government should give a “clear indication” as to whether or not it will protest the implementation of the bill.
Moreover, Ampareen said the Meghalaya Residents Safety and Security Act, 2016, was “insufficient” to attend to the fallout of the bill.
“We cannot take this for granted as we know that the ordinance to amend the act has not become effective. We have seen that the facilitation centres are still not in operation. We don’t know whether the act will cover the threat over the bill,” she said.
In a statement, the Meghalaya Pradesh Youth Congress slammed the National People’s Party, Conrad and home minister James P.K. Sangma.
“When the whole of the Northeast is opposing the bill, the NPP should do away with hypocrisy and double standards and clear their stand on this communally motivated bill once and for all,” youth Congress president Richard M. Marak said.
Instead of objecting to the BJP’s idea of one nation, one language, one religion, why was Conrad and NPP still supporting the BJP, he asked. “Is it only for their own greed for power and money? Conrad should earn the name of iconic hero of Northeast by straightening his spine and dissolving the North-East Democratic Alliance immediately,” he said.",states
Meghalaya organic tea launched under name Arsla," Arsla, a new brand of organic tea, was launched here on Saturday, adding another feather to Meghalaya’s cap as far as bringing areas under organic tea cultivation is concerned.

Co-promoter of Arsla tea, K.W. Chyne, said tea cultivation was started in 2003-2004 by a few tea growers with the support of the Tea Development Centre. The centre advised them to go for organic tea plantation from 2010-2011 onwards, after which the firm was set up in 2013. It applied for group organic certification of Arsla tea the same year.
Meghalaya assistant director (horticulture) and officer-on-special duty of the directorate of food processing, Maqbool L. Suiam, who was present at the function, said the first group organic certification was done for organic tea produced in the Mawlyngot area in East Khasi Hills district and Umsning in Ri Bhoi district in 2009-2010.
“Apart from Arsla tea, we have four branches of organic tea which include Urlong, Meg, Denmar and Lakyrsiew tea,” Suiam said.
Mawlyngot has around 50 hectares under organic tea cultivation and the whole state now has around 150 hectares of land under organic tea cultivation.
Ri Bhoi district alone has around 600 tea farmers, and the whole state has around 1,500 farmers. The total area of tea cultivation in the state is around 2,000 hectares. ",states
Rescuers find just 3 helmets in Meghalaya mine accident site," Meghalaya police have arrested the owner of the coal mine in East Jaintia Hills where 13 miners are feared trapped.
While search and rescue operations have been going on since Thursday, a day after the mishap occurred, there has been no positive development as the water inside the mine is yet to be pumped out.
Police said a raid was conducted at Norwan village on Friday night and Jrin alias Krip Chulet was arrested.
East Jaintia Hills superintendent of police Sylvester Nongtnger said over phone on Saturday that Chulet was the “main accused”. “He is the owner of the coal mine,” Nongtnger said.
On Friday, police declared that James Sukhlain was the owner.
But Nongtnger clarified that Chulet is the “main accused” and Sukhlain was a “co-accused”.
Chulet has been booked under Sections 188, 304A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, Section 3(2)(d) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, and Section 21(1) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act.
The same sections have also been applied to Sukhlain, who is “absconding”.
On reports that there are more than 13 people trapped in the mine, Nongtnger said they are yet to ascertain whether more people are trapped since the rescue operations have not yielded any results so far.
Over 100 personnel have been pressed into service since Friday morning to retrieve the 13 miners from the coal mine at Ksan near the Lyteiñ river under Saipung police station. They include officers and men from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Guwahati, State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and from the civil defence, Jowai, West Jaintia Hills.
The 13 miners include three locals from Lumthari village while the remaining 10 are from the plains belt of West Garo Hills and Assam. Sukhlain is also from Lumthari.
Official sources said the mine is 320 feet deep, and the water inside is around 70 feet deep. The mine is divided into sub-channels, sources said.
“Even after pumping, the water level in the mine has not reduced. We have not been able to locate the water source responsible for filling up of the mine although we suspect that it is connected to the river,” a source said.
On Saturday, three more pumps were pressed into service, apart from two pumps which were used since Friday.
The NDRF personnel also utilised Sonar, a technique that uses sound propagation to detect objects on or under the surface of the water.
“The Sonar technique did not indicate any positive result in the main tunnel but our rescuers dived twice up to 25-30 feet. The visibility in the water is almost nil,” a source said.

The Darjeeling Hotel Owners’ Association placed the demand before the “Prime Minister, chief minister, union tourism minister and the GTA chairman” on Saturday, three days before Narendra Modi announced a package of Rs 20 lakh crore.
Tourism industry stakeholders have in their pleas to the leaders stated “that the travel and tourism sector is not expected to get anywhere near normal before the middle of 2021— and that is an optimistic target in the present circumstances”.
The demands listed in the letter are: “We want an exemption from GST for at least the next financial year. An exemption from paying IT for this financial year would help us directly.”
A hotelier said: “Exemption from PF payment by 2 per cent of TDS will not have a major impact on small and medium hotels like us and this is why we are stressing on GST and IT payment exemption.”
Explaining the rationale behind the demand, the hotelier said that once the industry begins to get back on its feet, every hotel would be forced to cut tariff. “Since we will not be able to sell our rooms as per our current tariff, we should be exempted from paying GST,” he said.
Given the vulnerability of the travel sector during the pandemic, demands are being raised for tax waivers.
“A waiver of municipality tax and rates and electricity bills for the lockdown period and other state rates and taxes like fire licence fees, SARAI tax and profession taxes so as to help us survive, is a request we have placed,” said an industry member.
Many hotels have paid salaries to their employees during the lockdown period but the question remains “for how long”? “This is why some direct financial stimulus to enable them to pay salaries of employees for at least the next eight to 12 months is what we are looking at,” said a hotelier.
Darjeeling town alone has nearly 380 hotels and the lockdown began when the “peak tourism season” was starting.",states
Odisha farmers defy prohibitory order," Hundreds of farmers, under the banner of Naba Nirman Krushak Sangathan, on Monday defied prohibitory orders, broke police cordon and tried to enter the city to press their demands for price, prestige and pension.
Their proposed rally in the city could not take place with sangathan chief Akshya Kumar and other farmer leaders being arrested. However, the state government formed an inter-ministerial committee, headed by finance minister Sashi Bhushan Behera, to look into their demands. The other members of committee are agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy and co-operation minister Surya Narayan Patra.
For the past six months, the sangathan members have been organising rallies in various parts of the state in support of their demands. They had launched a statewide Jana Satyagraha Yatra programme from October 29. Farmers from various parts of the state were marching to the city under the programme.
The farmers tried to enter the city from two sides — Tamando and Hanshpal. While those coming from Berhampur and nearby places were stopped at various points, including Tamando and Khandagiri, the farmers marching from the Cuttack-side were detained at Hanshapal. Police commissioner Satyajit Mohanty said: “We arrested them in the larger interest of the state.”
On the other hand, Kumar said: “If the farmers are not allowed to enter the city, we will not allow the ruling party leaders to enter our villages. The basic issues of the farmers should be addressed.”
Congress leader Pradeep Majhi and expelled BJD leader Baijayant ‘Jay’ Panda were seen talking to farmers and marching with them in an expression of solidarity. The BJP and the Congress condemned the arrest of the farmers.
Behera said: “We are one of the first states to introduce an agriculture budget for farmer empowerment. We are providing loans to farmers at 1 per cent. As for the minimum support price of farm produce, the state government has been demanding that it be fixed at one-and-a-half times the cost of production. Farmers should come to the negotiation table.”",states
"Jharkhand cops, banks to check ATMs"," City police are drawing up a plan to conduct security audits of all ATMs and point-of-sale (POS) machines at malls and shops to curb rising incidents of cyber fraud in the capital.
Policemen and bank officials will conduct manual inspection at ATMs to detect the presence of skimming devices using which electronic data can be stolen and cards cloned. Cops are also planning to train ATM guards to make them more aware about the new threats to security.
The recent victim of cyber con in the city is 66-year-old retired engineer of DVC from Calcutta, Subhas Chandra Goswami, who lost Rs 1.10 lakh from his SBI account after his ATM card was apparently cloned by fraudsters.
“This is a new kind of security threat in Ranchi. Regular security audits of ATMs and POS machines at business installations are required. After Chhath, we will hold a meeting with officials of banks and police stations for regular security checks,” Ranchi SSP Anish Gupta said on Monday.
There are over 400 ATMs in Ranchi.

The SSP said Ranchi police and the cyber crime department were planning to conduct regular awareness drives informing people about the modus operandi of cyber criminals. “Instructions on safe transactions are displayed inside ATM kiosks, but we need to create awareness about new methods and tools used in the crime,” the SSP added.
Goswami had come to celebrate Diwali with his daughter’s family at Sector 3 in Dhurwa. He had last swiped his ATM card on November 2 at the ATM of IDBI Bank at Hinoo to withdraw Rs 10,000.
Between 11.45pm on Saturday and 6am on Sunday, his account was cleaned out. Goswami lodged an FIR at Dhurwa police station on Sunday.
Before Goswami, three similar cases were reported in the city within a span of two months.
Minakshi Kumari Ravi, a PhD scholar at Ranchi University, lost Rs 80,000 while Kadru resident Khalid Jamil Akhtar lost Rs 5,000. Ranchi-based journalist T. Vijay Raghvan was swindled out of Rs 69,500.
Ranchi police could not make much headway in any of these cases except finding out that inter-state gangs were involved in the frauds.
Gang busted
Jamshedpur: Steel city police on Monday busted a gang of cyber criminals and arrested its two members for fraudulently withdrawing money from ATMs.
The arrested were identified as Mohammed Kasim (34) and Mohammed Salim Rajkadri (22), residents of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.
City SP Prabhat Kumar said deputy manager of the SBI’s Bistupur branch Ranjan Gorai had on November 1 lodged an FIR stating that Rs 37,000 had been withdrawn from the bank’s Sonari Ram Mandir branch through fraudulent ATM transactions.
“Cyber cops swung into action and nabbed Kasim and Salim from Bistupur. During interrogation, the duo described how they pulled off the con,” Kumar told the media.
The city SP said the gang had conducted a recce of over 200 ATMs across the city and zeroed in on those lacking security guards and having power switch inside.
“The accused had opened multiple accounts in different banks and obtained ATM cards. They would enter an ATM of their choice and swipe a card. As soon as the cash came out, they would turn off the power switch and call up the customer care to inform about a failure in transaction. Within a week, the bank would deposit the money into the account concerned,” the city SP explained.
A dozen ATM cards of various banks, PAN and Aadhaar cards besides five cellphones were recovered from the duo. ",states
At home in a Tata Nano for 50 days & counting," If you thought the Tata Nano was a tight squeeze, think again.
While 50 days of lockdown has become a national milestone, Paras Dwivedi, 45, of Sagar in Madhya Pradesh, has his own.
Dwivedi has passed some 50 days sitting and sleeping in his Nano at the landmark Chouparan petrol bunk along the GT Road in Hazaribagh.

Asked about his journey from hometown Sagar, Dwivedi said he got a “call from mother goddess” at the Kamakhya temple in Guwahati, Assam, which is why he started on March 22.
His Nano ran into trouble at Chouparan in two days after an 850km drive. That happened to be March 24 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the first nationwide lockdown. The lockdown came into effect from Wednesday and Dwivedi got stuck.
“My car wouldn’t start and the lockdown started, I couldn’t get a mechanic to fix it,” he said. “I got a mechanic but he demanded Rs 10,000. I did not have that kind of money. So I made my Nano my home.”
Local residents and NGOs have tried to help out Dwivedi with food. But a man has his pride, he said with dignity. “I am running short of money, but I don’t like having anything for free. Also, I try and eat only fruits. I am a spiritual man,” he said. “I’d be grateful if someone reading this helps me fix my car so that I can go to the Kamakhya temple.”
His mother and sister who live in Sagar may be worried about him, he said, but he has put his destiny in the hands of divine powers, he said.
What about his career? “I used to be a lawyer but my licence is now cancelled,” he said but did not elaborate.
On Wednesday, Chouparan block development officer Amit Kumar Srivastava met Dwivedi and offered him food and other basics. The BDO later told The Telegraph that Dwivedi was just keen on getting his car fixed and going to the Kamakhya temple. “He refused to give me his mother’s contact number. Let the lockdown end, I will help him go wherever he wants.”",states
Rajdhani Express chugs in with shocks," Around 1,200 stranded passengers, including migrant workers, who came to Ranchi from Delhi on Rajdhani Express on Thursday morning were happy to reach Ranchi station but their joy evaporated very soon.
They expected they would be welcomed by officials with flowers, water and food, and taken home on buses, mirroring the government’s standard protocol when labourers reach home on special Shramik trains.
Instead, the Rajdhani passengers were greeted by buses and cabs who quoted “exorbitant rates”.
“This is like falling from the sky. We underwent thermal screening after we alighted from the train at the station. Then authorities asked us our districts we belong to. In Delhi too we received a phone call seeking details of our addresses. So we expected minimal arrangements such as a free bus service, but outside the station there was nothing,” said Md Nasim Ansari of Pakur district, a labourer in Delhi, who returned with two of his friends.
One of his friends, Shamshul Ansari, said that for each ticket they spent Rs 1,786.
“Then, we saw buses on the parking area and travel company employees booking tickets. We thought that it was free of cost. But when we contacted the booking counter of Farhan Travels in the parking area, the agent said they charged Rs 14 per km. Now Pakur is about 360km from Ranchi. That means I will have to pay minimum Rs 5,000. We friends have only Rs 3,000 between us. How we will go home?” Ansari said. Md Irfan of Chatra said that they were cheated everywhere. “In Delhi we got no support from the Delhi government and back in Jharkhand the situation is the same,” he said. “In Delhi, we lost our jobs, did not get food. Contractors threw us out and denied us wages. How will I go to Chatra now? Now it seems the only thing we can depend on is our own two feet.” He added they were not allowed to alight at Ramgarh, which was closer to Chatra than Ranchi.
Rupesh Paswan and Rohit Paswan from Giridih were seen standing outside Ranchi station. “This virus has broken us. We got fired, now we are back in our home state, empty-handed,” Rupesh said.
Bhavana, a native of Jamshedpur, lamented that she lost her job and exhausted her savings. “Private cabs are demanding anything between Rs 14 to Rs 20 per km and not only that, they will charge to-and-fro rates. Politicians will only shed crocodile tears,” she said.
Amarjeet and Chandraprit Kaur from Jamshedpur alleged complete chaos and mismanagement inside the train.
“The toilet was dirty. Attendants did not respond and there was no sanitiser,” said Amarjeet. “Hellish ride.”
Ranchi deputy commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray denied any mismanagement at Ranchi station.
“From the start, we made it clear that the state government will not arrange buses for passengers coming by the Rajdhani Express. They have to pay for their onward journey. Around 60 buses and 50 cabs were given permission to take these passengers to their districts for pay,” said the DC.
It is also unclear if these passengers will undergo the Covid-19 test.",states
22 dangerous ghats out of bounds for Chhath," The Patna district administration on Monday declared 22 ghats unsafe for devotees for the ensuing Chhath festival.
The administration has earmarked 80 ghats as safe for worshipping the Sun god.
Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi made the announcement following physical inspection of the ghats, based on which a detailed report was submitted by the nodal officers.
“Altogether 22 ghats have been identified as dangerous for the devotees. They would be barricaded off from the approach road itself with signboards informing residents they cannot use these ghats. Police personnel would be deployed to guide the residents,” Ravi told The Telegraph.
The ghats which have been declared dangerous and will be out of bounds for Chhath devotees are: Kurji Ghat, Patliputra Ghat, Shiva Ghat, Meenar Ghat, LCT Ghat, TN Banerjee Ghat, Mishri Ghat, Judges Ghat, Adalatganj Ghat, Vanshi Ghat, Sipahi Ghat, BN College Ghat, Bankipore Club Ghat, Jahaz Ghat, Anta Ghat, Khazekala Ghat, Mirchai Ghat, Garariya Ghat, Nurrudinganj Ghat, Keshav Rai Ghat, Adrak Ghat and Nandgola Ghat.

While declaring a ghat to be dangerous, the administration considered the following parameters: Stagnant water, muddy and marshy land, how far the water level is from the bank, the depth of water, the presence of heavy boulders and poor condition of approach roads. Ravi said that at some ghats, there was no water at all.
The list of the dangerous ghats would be uploaded on the district administration’s website shortly. Ravi appealed to the residents not to visit the dangerous ghats at any cost.
“In the next two days, we will also launch the mobile application for the Chhath festival through which people will get all details pertaining to the ghats and the arrangements made over there,” Ravi said.
Monday was the last day to make the ghats festival ready. Ravi said he inspected the ghats by steamer as well as by road and found that the work done was satisfactory.
“Overall I found the work to be satisfactory. A few things are left which would be completed by tonight (Monday night). Barricading work has been completed at most of the ghats along with other arrangements like portable urinals, changing rooms, watch towers, lighting, control rooms and approach roads,” the DM said.
SDRF and NDRF teams would be deployed to carry out rescue work in case of any eventuality. ",states
Third Covid-19 case found in Jamshedpur," The third Covid-19 positive case from the steel city was reported on Thursday even as one of the two earlier young patients from Chakulia being treated at the Tata Main Hospital (TMH) tested negative at the corporate hospital on Wednesday evening.
East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Ravi Shanker Shukla confirmed the third case, saying the person is a resident of the steel city.
'The man was tested positive coronavirus positive on Thursday afternoon is a resident of steel city and had returned from Calcutta on May 11. He was in the isolation ward of the MGM Medical College and Hospital ever since returning here and finally his swab sample tested positive,” said Shukla.
The DC said the patient in question had been shifted from the medical college and hospital’s isolation ward to the TMH Covid ward late in the afternoon.
The man’s age is not definitively known, he used to work as a labourer in Calcutta and had returned to his hometown here by road on Monday.
“Though the patient is a resident of a slum, he did not go home and instead came to MGM Medical College and Hospital at Sakchi and requested for a Covid test, given his health. He was kept in the hospital’s isolation ward with 61 other suspected persons. His swab sample had been taken for a test on Monday and eventually he tested positive on Thursday afternoon,” said a senior health officer.
Earlier on Tuesday, a youth and a girl from Chakulia block in Ghatshila sub-division of the district, were tested positive and put in the TMH’s Covid ward. Thirteen other Chakulia residents, suspected to have come in contact with the duo, were also put in an isolation ward at the TMH.
The girl tested negative in the virology lab of the TMH on Wednesday evening.
The district health authorities maintained that they will consider the girl’s test report genuine if it comes from the virology lab at the state-run MGM Medical College only.
However, TMH has the same RT-PCR machine like the ones installed at the medical college's virology lab.
District civil surgeon Dr Maheshwar Prasad said he was aware that one of the two Covid patients admitted at the TMH on Tuesday tested negative at the virology lab of the TMH. “But we do not take into account the test conducted by the TMH. We will only consider the test done by the MGM Medical College's virology lab. Also, the patient who has tested negative will have to undergo more tests before being finally declared Covid-free.”
A member of the doctors’ fraternity in the city wondered about the district health department’s stand on the TMH. “On one hand, they say TMH is the best treatment centre for Covid-19, on the other hand they won’t accept a report of TMH. What is this?”",states
NRC-excluded continue to protest," The North East Linguistic & Ethnic Coordination Committee staged demonstrations in the Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi in south Assam on Tuesday to push for their seven-point charter of demands, including unconditional citizenship to Hindus who came to India from neighbouring countries owing to religious persecution.
The protesters submitted a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and governor Jagdish Mukhi through the deputy commissioners of the respective districts on the precarious and miserable condition of the religious minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh who had to settle in India in the aftermath of Partition and Bangladesh War.
The memorandum, signed by the committee’s general secretary, Kankan Narayan Sikidar, said about 14 lakh “persecuted minorities” were affected by the NRC.
It said the final NRC published on August 31 appeared to be replete with errors as newer instances were coming to light each day about foreigners being included and eligible persons being excluded from it. It said it would not accept the final NRC.
It pointed out that during the NRC update, refugee cards and documents from neighbouring states were rejected by NRC officials, though these were mentioned in the standard operating procedure, making the situation worse.

It demanded unconditional citizenship for Hindus who came to India from Pakistan and Bangladesh following religious persecution, their inclusion in the NRC and implementation of the Centre’s notification dated September 7, 2015, regarding safeguarding religiously persecuted Hindus. It alleged that the notification was implemented in all the states, barring Assam.
The notification was issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and its provisions were applicable in the entire country.
The memorandum demanded passing of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill after some rectification to provide relief to Hindus.
It said the committee would not tolerate imposition of any kind of reservation in Assam under Clause 6 of the Assam Accord.
It demanded proportionate representation of various linguistic communities and ethnic groups in the high-level committee, constituted by the Centre to examine the feasibility of implementation of Clause 6.
It also demanded that “persecuted” linguistic and ethnic communities, including Bengali Hindus, be considered indigenous people as they are citizens of undivided India. It demanded release of all religiously persecuted minorities from detention camps in Assam.
The agitation was supported by several organisations, including the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), RSS, Bajrang Dal and the Hindu Jagaran Mancha.
The committee’s adviser, Subhrangshu Bhattacharjee, claimed that more than 30,000 people converged for the demonstration in the three districts.",states
"Juicy Kashmiri apples in Jamshedpur, but reality bites"," The famous Kashmiri apples have started reaching the steel city, much to the delight of fruit-lovers who were sceptical about receiving this gift from the troubled Valley this year, in the wake of a lockdown after Article 370 was revoked on August 5.
Trucks with consignments of apples started arriving from Kashmir since Sunday, said fruit wholesalers in steel city.
Md Shaheed Hussain, a large whole-seller of Kashmiri apples in Sakchi, normally four trucks from Srinagar with two varieties of Kashmiri apples, American and Dilshan, came to them at the godown of Krishi Utpad bazaar Samiti in Parsudih every day this time of the year.
“This year, it has been a late start. So far, only two trucks of apples are coming every day from Srinagar since Sunday. We hope normal supply resumes in the next two-three weeks,” he said on Tuesday.
But Hussain said that though consignments of apples had started coming from Srinagar and it meant that transport from the interiors of Kashmir had been gradually easing up, telecommunication glitches continued.
“We have been using cellphones for years to communicate with Srinagar. This time, we had to go back in time and use STD calls and landlines. Cell phone calls still don’t go through to Kashmir,” Hussain said.
He added that the wholesale price of Kashmiri American apples was between Rs 50 and Rs 60 a kilo while that of Dilshan was between Rs 60 and Rs 70. “Considering the circumstances, the price hike from last year is marginal, around 10 per cent,” he said.
Customers can’t believe their luck.
Capt N.N. Jha, a senior physician and a resident of Kadma, said Kashmiri apples were his favourite fruit. “I believe in the old adage that an apple a day keeps the doctor away, and I prefer Kashmir’s apples over every other variety,” he said. “I’m glad the apples are reaching the city, given the situation after Article 370 was scrapped,” he said.
Bistupur-based businessman Piyush Mehta said the sight of red apples from Kashmir brightened up the fruit mart. “Signs of hope,” he said.
The Telegraph had reported on September 15 that very few Kashmiri shawl-walas could reach the steel city with their wares. But, the situation has improved in the past nine days. Kashmiri shawl trader Fayaz Ahmed, 50, who reached here last Wednesday, told this reporter that he personally knew that about two dozen Kashmiri shawl traders had reached Jamshedpur. “Shawl traders have started coming from not only Srinagar but Sopore and Anantnag,” said Ahmed.
On the situation there, Srinagar resident Ahmed said: “The Valley was swarming with paramilitary forces and people had to show their ID cards whenever asked by the men in uniform. Most shops are still closed, cellphone service is not operating and neither is the local public transport system. One has to use one’s personal vehicle if one wants to get around.”",states
Yoga guru Dibya Sundar Das dead at 68," Dibya Sundar Das, the yoga practitioner who travelled across the world to spread the discipline, breathed his last in the city on Wednesday morning. He was 68.

Das had founded the first centre of the World Yoga Society in Salt Lake in 1986. The Society now has 10 centres in the city and 162 affiliated centres across the world.
“Our father had taken four of us to yoga guru the late Yogindra Bishnu Charan Ghosh to learn yoga in the early 60s and it all started from there,” his elder brother Prem Sundar Das said on Wednesday.
“The society was started to give people a healthy mind and body. This was what our father, Ashutosh Das, believed in,” Prem Sundar, adviser to the World Yoga Society, said.

10km of defunct cables removed in Calcutta," More than 10km of dud cables were removed from posts on just one stretch of Harish Mukherjee Road on Thursday.
Many other areas in the city will be cleared of such cables, said multi-system operators (MSOs) and broadband service providers.
The push came at a meeting on Tuesday between the operators and Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators. Sources said Hakim had a stern message for the operators — remove the defunct cables as soon as possible.

Old cables that have long outlived their utility have been dangling from posts, all jumbled up, for years. Civic officials have attributed the high count of electric poles felled by Cyclone Amphan to the weight of cables on them.

Around six MSOs and a couple of broadband providers sent teams to Harish Mukherjee Road on Thursday morning. They worked well into the afternoon but could only cover a portion of the road.
“We covered around 20 lamp posts from Mitra Institution to Balwant Singh Dhaba,” said Niloy Sarkar, a worker in the team of GTPL-KCBPL.
The process took time because the workers found it tough to tell a defunct cable from a functional one.
The total length of the defunct cables removed from the road would be “well over 10km”, said Suresh Sethia, the director of Siti Cable.
Stretches in Alipore will be taken up after Harish Mukherjee Road is free of defunct wires, MSOs said.
A senior official of another MSO said at least 100 trucks would be needed to carry all the dud wires from the city.
The challenge
Removing dud cables is a baby step towards fixing the overhead menace, said civic officials and urban planners. The real solution was building underground conduits, they said. But the job is easier said than done.
Metro had in May 2019 reported that the CMC had readied a plan to bury the mesh of dangling cables. But the project never took off.
“Late last year, the plan was sent to the state government for approval. The money was supposed to have come from the government, not the civic body. The approval is still pending,” said a CMC official.
Architect and urban planner Abin Chaudhuri said it was ironic that it took a calamity for people to take notice of the overhead cable menace.
“During normal times, we insist the local cable operator draws a cable through that very mess. We are also to blame,” he said.",states
MLA diktat on school fees triggers query over power," Trinamul MLA Baishali Dalmiya has issued a notice to private schools in her constituency in Howrah’s Bally asking them not to take fees from students for April, May and June.
Several schools in the area raised the question whether an MLA had the “power” to ask them to waive off fees of every student.
The notice, on Dalmiya’s letterhead as “Member, West Bengal Legislative Assembly”, was put up outside the gates of the schools or mailed to the managements.
“This is hereby inform to all the Authorities of Schools under Bally Constituency not to take any kind of fees from parents of respective students of your school for the months of April, May & June 2020 and no admission charges to the existing students for the new session as well as no bus fares for the last 3 months as per the directives of Education Ministry of Government of West Bengal,” the notice reads.
No order has been issued by the state government so far regarding waiving students’ fees for the three months, the schools said.
Metro asked education minister Partha Chatterjee whether an MLA could issue such a notice without the government’s approval. He said that as education minister, he could not comment on an MLA’s decision.
“But I will definitely talk to her and find out what prompted her to ask the schools not to take fees,” Chatterjee said. All 35 schools served the notice are part of Dalmiya’s constituency, across Liluah, Belur and Bally.
Dalmiya said that “as an individual” and “also as the local MLA”, she felt she had the responsibility to “request” the schools to give some relief to the parents. She said several parents were suffering because the lockdown had robbed them of their earnings.
“Schools charge fees from students from Nursery to Class XII. We are all going through a difficult time. Many parents have no income. They are suffering. Why can’t the schools offer them some relief by not charging any fees for three months?” Dalmiya told this newspaper.
According to Dalmiya, the schools’ expenses have gone down because they have not been operating since the lockdown had been imposed.
“The schools teach students to be kind, to help the needy and to be honest. This is the time when the schools should practise what they teach their students,” she said.
Asked how the schools would pay the teachers and other employees if the students did not pay fees, the MLA said: “Schools will have to arrange the teachers’ salaries.”
“The government asked us not to implement the fee hike this year. We have not implemented it.... We have not forced any parent to pay the fees if they had difficulty…. How can an MLA ask us not to take fees from any student for three months?” a principal asked.",states
Paralysed migrant back by car," A migrant worker in his mid-50s who suffered a paralytic attack in Jammu during the lockdown is back home in Malda, thanks to a panchayat member of his locality.
Twenty-four hours after his return, Mosharaf Hossain still can’t believe that he is finally back at Shukurditola village under Uttar Laxmipur panchayat in Kaliachak II block of Malda district.
His wife, children as well as his ailing parents do not know how to thank Fazle Karim Akhtar, a Trinamul panchayat member in his late 30s, who drove to Delhi to bring back Hossain and two other migrant workers.
Akhtar, also the teacher-in-charge of a BEd College, downplayed his role in reuniting Hossain with his family.
“It was bliss to see Hossain’s aged parents embracing him affectionately. That is my reward,” the young panchayat member said.
In February this year, Hossain went to Jammu to work at a construction site. When the nationwide lockdown was announced in March, Hossain suffered a nervous breakdown when he could not arrange his return home. “He eventually suffered a paralytic attack and was admitted to a hospital in Jammu,” one of his family members said.
The extension of the lockdown in phases made him more anxious and ill.
Back in Malda, his parents and children, who were aware of his plight, were equally upset as they could not find a way to bring him back.
The family then approached Akhtar, who quickly made a decision.
“Within a couple of hours, Akhtar decided to take a car to Jammu to bring Hossain back. On May 26, he left the village in an SUV with Masiruddin Sheikh Montu, a local youth who knows driving,” said a villager.
In Jammu, two other migrant workers from Malda who used to work with Hossain, took him to New Delhi by a train. There, they took shelter at the station and were virtually starving.
On the way to Jammu, Akhtar came to know that Hossain had reached Delhi with a couple of other workers. So Akhtar and Montu went to Delhi .
Akhtar said it was an ordeal to trace the trio. “Their cellphone batteries were off. After searching the station for four hours, we found them huddled in one corner, hungry. I shared the muri, chirey and biscuits that I had carried from home. They simply gobbled up the food in minutes. We got them fresh clothes and then headed for Malda,” Akhtar said.
On Tuesday evening, they reached Malda where Hossain was first taken home and then to an institutional quarantine centre.
Mausam Noor, Rajya Sabha member and Malda district Trinamul chief, appreciated Akhtar’s efforts. “He is indeed a true torchbearer of Trinamul. We need such young leaders in the party.”",states
Covid-19 cases go north in north Bengal,"  North Bengal saw a spike in novel coronavirus cases on Wednesday with 38 new patients from five districts.
In Cooch Behar, all new 16 patients were migrant workers who came back from Maharashtra, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh to their homes in Dinhata, Tufanganj and Cooch Behar Sadar subdivisions, said a district official. This apart, 10 new cases were reported from Malda, three persons tested positive in Alipurduar, two in North Dinajpur and seven in South Dinajpur.
With these 16 new cases, there have been 132 infections in Cooch Behar alone — mostly from Dinhata. Around 30 patients were discharged after recovery.
Darjeeling MP Raju Bista visited the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday for a medical check-up. The MP, who came here from Delhi on May 28 and has been in self-quarantine, spoke to the hospital superintendent and health officials on the Covid-19 situation. “The state should inspect all quarantine centres and check if social distancing is maintained there. If we do not take care of quarantine centres properly, there’s no point of keeping people there,” said the BJP MP.
Sikkim’s second case
One Covid-19 case was reported from Sikkim, the second such in the Himalayan state that had been virtually Covid-19-free till recently. The asymptomatic patient, a man in his mid-50s who was at a quarantine facility near Rangpo town, tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday.
He had returned from Delhi on May 25 and was quarantined with his daughter and nephew, who tested negative.
“The patient has been shifted to the New STNM Hospital, Sikkim’s only dedicated Covid-19 hospital. Though his two primary contacts tested negative, we are in process of tracing his secondary contacts to ensure there is no community spread of the disease in Sikkim,” said a health official.
This is the second case of Covid-19 in Sikkim on the heels of the one on May 23 when a 25-year-old man, who returned from Delhi and was quarantined at an institutional facility in South Sikkim, was found infected. The youth, officials said, is recovering at the New STNM Hospital.",states

Since the closure of Tallah bridge to buses and mini-buses, RG Kar Road has witnessed a sudden surge in the number of vehicles that are either headed for Dunlop or Jessore Road. Despite police deployment, what has contributed to the mess is heavy pedestrian crossover near RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.
“We have principally agreed to work out an alternative for pedestrians near the hospital,” said a senior officer of the transport department. “Since we are looking at a three-year period before heavy vehicles can again start plying on Tallah bridge, it would be necessary to have some infrastructure for pedestrians around this point.”

The gates of the hospital open on RG Kar Road and every day hundreds keep crossing over to the other side where rows of medicine shops are located. “We told the transport minister that this would only add to the mess over the next few months. If some alternative can worked out for pedestrians, vehicles would at least move,” said Pradip Narayan Bose, a leader of the bus operators’ union in north Calcutta.
Bus operators had flagged their concern at a meeting with Suvendu Adhikari on Monday last. Transport department officials visited the area on Tuesday to understand the mess and how pedestrians could be regulated.
“If we have to think of a foot overbridge then it must have escalators,” said an officer. “But before that we have to see out how much of space would be available for it.”
A senior officer said once the traffic survey was completed, the government would decide whether CMDA or the Calcutta Municipal Corporation would construct the foot overbridge or underpass. ",states
"Clicks, cake and a sleepy passenger in Calcutta"," Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee cut a cake at Delhi airport on Tuesday afternoon, posed for pictures with the airline crew and co-passengers and slept through the entire length of the flight to Calcutta.
The Nobel laureate was on seat 1A on IndiGo’s flight 6E 283.
Before take-off, the pilot stepped out of the cockpit and met him. “The pilot announced that IndiGo was proud to have a Nobel laureate as its passenger. He then asked for a round of applause for Banerjee from the passengers. All the passengers clapped,” said Purna Chandra Maity, a Calcutta businessman who was on the same flight.
Banerjee slept through most of the journey, said a doctor who was accompanying him on the flight.
“Even when he was dozing, people were taking selfies with him,” said Calcutta-based gastroenterologist Abhijit Chowdhury said.
Banerjee had a cup of tea on the flight and refused food offered by the airline. “He was complaining of a sore throat,” Chowdhury said.
As the flight landed and Banerjee got up to leave, the cabin crew took pictures with him.
Some passengers even walked up and spoke to him.
Maity asked Banerjee a question that he has heard several times in the recent past — what did he think of the Indian economy. “It will take some time to recover,” he is supposed to have said.
There was a mini celebration at the boarding gate too. “We saw him cutting a cake organised by the airline staff. The cake was distributed among passengers,” Maity said.",states
Hope & poser in JBVNL power-firm switch," Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd (JBVNL) consumers living in Jamshedpur and adjoining areas can hope for better power supply as the JBVNL’s Singhbhum electricity supply area board has replaced the existing outsourced agency, Quess Corporation Ltd, with a new one.
The new agency, Geetraj Engineering Enterprises Pvt Ltd (GEEPL), which is working for the JBVNL in Seraikela, Chaibasa and Chakradharpur divisions, has been entrusted to work under Jamshedpur and Mango divisions also.
But what seems to be a deviation in appointing the GEEPL for the Jamshedpur and Mango divisions is that the Singhbhum electricity supply area board did not float any tender and engaged the new agency by issuing an order.

Executive engineer, Jamshedpur division, Vishal Kumar said the new agency had working in place of Quess Corporation Ltd from October 1 this year.
“The term of Quess Corporation came to an end on September 30, leading the Singhbhum electricity supply area board to appoint GEEPL as the new agency. But as the new agency has been appointed by the Singhbhum electricity supply area board only, we cannot say anything about it,” Kumar said.
General manager, JBVNL's Singhbhum electricity supply area, Arvind Kumar could not be contacted for comment despite repeated attempts.
An insider in the JBVNL pointed out that the appointment of a new agency without tender process deviation from the set norms.
“In any case no agency can be given work at a new area without tender even if the agency in question is already engaged at other divisions of the JBVNL. Had the GEEPL worked here under Mango and Jamshedpur divisions, and the area board had given an extension for the agency’s contract, there would have been no problem as the board has the power to give three months’ extension to any existing agency,” said the official, requesting anonymity.
The insider, however, pointed out that the GEEPL is a good agency which has earned a reputation of providing prompt service in rectifying power snags and also in giving safety aspects of its workers priority in Seraikela, Chakradharpur and Chaibasa divisions.
Arvind Kumar Thakur, director, GEEPL, said they have been given the contract for one year to work in Jamshedpur and Mango divisions.
“Though we have been given additional areas to provide service, we will not give any opportunity for complaint from the consumers. As we have been engaged for providing service in Jamshedpur and Mango divisions in an urgent way, we are yet to start working in a full-fledged manner,” said Thakur.
He said that all the workers who were working for the Quess Corporation will be absorbed with his company. He said the workers would be given appointment letters in a week’s time, adding that they have sent a team of to Calcutta for buying the necessary safety gear such as gumboots, hand-gloves and testers to all the 209 workers who will be working in Jamshedpur and Mango divisions shortly.
The JBVNL does engage outsourced agencies for things like maintaining power supply to the consumers with the guidance of JBVNL's engineers and technicians.
JBVNL consumers living in Mango, Azadnagar, Jugsalai, Uliyan, Shastrinagar, Govindpur, Baridih, Bagbera and Parsudih often have to suffer irregular power supply, which is ascribed to poor maintenance work.",states
Anupam Kher loses Jharkhand film panel post," Actor Anupam Kher will no longer head the Jharkhand Film Technical Advisory Committee with the state government indicating that his absence from meetings may have been the trigger.
Information and public relations department secretary Sunil Barnwal said steps had been initiated to replace Kher, who was nominated in May 2016 as the head of the committee that was set up to review film making proposals for which the state government would provide various types of incentives and subsidies.
Kher recently resigned from the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune citing overseas film commitments.

“So far, Anupam Kher hasn’t participated in a single meeting. This, in turn, has been affecting disposal of film proposals that would be shot and produced under state’s film policy of 2015. We have initiated moves to replace Kher. He is holding an honorary position and is, therefore, not entitled to financial benefits,” Barnwal, who is also principal secretary to the chief minister, clarified to the media on Tuesday.
The members of the committee are film makers Imtiyaz Ali and Mahesh Manjhi, general secretary of Federation of Film Societies of India Amitava Ghosh, musician Bullu Ghosh, folk artist Mukund Nayak, theatre personality Ajay Malkani, All India Santhali Association president Ramesh Hansda and former Ranchi university professor Ratan Prakash.
Barnwal addressed the media on preparations for 49th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) that began on Tuesday in Goa. Jharkhand is the focus state at this festival and November 24 would be celebrated there as Jharkhand Day.
Seven films shot in Jharkhand will be screened at IFFI. These are M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, Begum Jaan, A Death in the Gunj, Panchlait, Mor Gaon Mor Desh, Ranchi Diaries and Ajab Singh ki Gajab Kahani.
While folk dances like Chhau, Paika and Nagpuri will also be showcased, visitors will be told about Jharkhand’s rich culture and scenic beauty to pitch it as an ideal destination for shooting films.
“Over 212 films from 68 countries will be screened at the fest. We have sent invitations to Bollywood celebrities like Vidya Balan, Mukesh Bhatt, Ravi Kishan, Vijay Swami, Ashwini Kumar, Yashpal Sharma and Rajesh Jais. We will also host a dinner there,” tourism secretary Rahul Sharma added. ",states
From scrap to Terminator model," Inspired by sci-fi films Predator and Terminator, students of multi-trade in the state government-run Industrial Training Institute (ITI) here have made two models out of waste and scrap materials of the discarded vehicles.
“I witnessed such models (not in waste and scrap materials) at the museums in Singapore when I had visited there under the skill development plan. On return, we decided to build the Predator and Terminator models, to which the students took very much interest,” said ITI principal Rajat Kumar Panigrahi.
The Terminator model is 13 feet and 6 inches high and made of 680kg of scrap materials of discarded trucks, bikes and other vehicles. Students of various trades, including fitter, welding, painting and others, have made this model during the past 15 days.
“We would install it in the ITI garden,” said Panigrahi. It would definitely encourage others for creativity and proper utilisation of waste materials, he said.
“Another 6 feet high Terminator model has already been made by the students. In it, 85kg of scrap parts of scooter and bike were used. We would install it in our scrap museum,” he said.
“Our students are excellent in their fascinating ideas and creations with waste materials. Many people throw off their old vehicle parts and electronic goods. Our students are using iron, electrical and many such materials in our workshop. We make the best out of waste. In future such creativity will fetch them income. Besides, it makes them feel good for having recycled the mechanical and the electronic waste.”
Some of the creations of the ITI students out of waste include a table lamp made of a kaput bike gear, flower vase with broken bathroom pipe fittings, wall clock with damaged bike and bicycle crank chain, a hanging scorpion with a broken bicycle chain, tractor with a damaged C clamp or a kaput sewing machine, elephants made of waste iron powder in the ITI workshop, a sofa set with unused motor tyres and many other constructive items.",states
Congress to oppose Narendra Modi rally in Aizawl," The ruling Congress has decided to use all its resources to oppose Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s November 22 visit to Aizawl to campaign for the November 28 Mizoram Assembly polls.
The Prime Minister will address a poll rally at Assam Rifles ground here, BJP office-bearers said.
While Modi was granted the Assam Rifles ground for the rally, the Congress president was allegedly denied the same ground because of the Union home ministry’s intervention, the Congress said.
Congress spokesperson Lallianchhunga said the party would use all its resources to oppose the visit after party president Rahul Gandhi was denied the ground. He said the state Congress on Sunday wrote to the Election Commission complaining about the discriminative policy of 23 sector Assam Rifles in allotment of their ground. He claimed the Congress had applied for the ground before the BJP.
“The preferential allotment of the Assam Rifles ground to the BJP and denial to the Congress is both unfair and undemocratic. It clearly violates the model code of conduct issued by the Election Commission. The Congress, therefore, demands the permission given to the BJP to use the ground be immediately cancelled,” Congress said, in its letter to the commission.
It also warned that the party would resort to agitation to stop the proposed rally by the Prime Minister if permission is not cancelled.
BJP rule unsafe: The Congress on Monday also levelled other charges against the BJP saying its rule is unsafe for Christian- dominated Mizoram. 
Lallianchhunga said the BJP is trying to rule Mizoram like it had done in Nagaland and Meghalaya by putting the regional parties and Northeast Democratic Alliance members in front.
He accused the BJP of trying to rule Mizoram through backdoor by using Neda members like Mizo National Front (MNF) and National People’s Party (NPP).
“The reason why NPP was launched in Mizoram just two months ahead of Assembly polls was because the BJP wanted to use it as its frontal force,” he alleged. ",states
China releases video of simulated attack on US," China’s air force has released a video showing nuclear-capable H-6 bombers carrying out a simulated attack on what appears to be Andersen Air Force Base on the US Pacific island of Guam, as regional tensions rise.
The video, released on Saturday on the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s Weibo account, came as China carried out a second day of drills near Chinese-claimed Taiwan, to express anger at the visit of a senior US state department official to Taipei.
Guam is home to major US military facilities, including the air base, which would be key to responding to any conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Chinese air force’s two minute and 15 second video, set to solemn, dramatic music like a trailer for a Hollywood movie, shows H-6 bombers taking off from a desert base. The video is called “The god of war H-6K goes on the attack!”
Halfway through, a pilot presses a button and looses off a missile at an unidentified seaside runway. The missile homes in on the runway, a satellite image of which looks exactly like the layout of Andersen. The music suddenly stops as images of the ground shaking appear, followed by aerial views of an explosion.
“We are the defenders of the motherland’s aerial security; we have the confidence and ability to always defend the security of the motherland’s skies,” the air force wrote in a brief description for the video.
Neither China’s defence ministry nor US Indo-Pacific Command immediately responded to requests for comment on the video.
Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore’s Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, said the video was aimed at highlighting China’s growing prowess in long-range power projection.
“The video is meant to warn the Americans that even supposedly safe, rearward positions such as Guam may come under threat when conflicts over regional flashpoints, be it Taiwan or South China Sea, erupt,” he said.",world
Britain warned of soaring Covid deaths," Britain will face an exponentially growing death rate from Covid-19 within weeks unless urgent action is taken to halt a rapidly spreading second wave of the outbreak, the country’s senior medics said on Monday.
The UK already has the biggest official Covid-19 death toll in Europe — and the fifth largest in the world — while it is borrowing record amounts in an attempt to pump emergency money through the damaged economy.
But new Covid-19 cases are rising by at least 6,000 per day in Britain, according to week-old data, hospital admissions are doubling every eight days, and the testing system is buckling.
Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, cautioned that if left unrestricted the epidemic would reach 50,000 new cases per day by mid-October in the UK.
“If this continued along the path... the number of deaths directly from Covid... will continue to rise, potentially on an exponential curve, that means doubling and doubling and doubling again and you can quickly move from really quite small numbers to really very large numbers,” Whitty said.

"US coronavirus death toll nears 200,000"," The death toll from the spread of coronavirus in the US was approaching over 200,000 lives on Monday, more than double the number of fatalities in India, the country reporting the second-highest number of cases in the world.
The US, on a weekly average, is now losing about 800 lives each day to the virus, according to a Reuters tally. That is down from a peak of 2,806 daily deaths recorded on April 15.
During the early months of the pandemic, 200,000 deaths were regarded by many as the maximum number of lives likely to be lost in the US to the virus.
Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump defended his handling of the crisis. He admitted to playing down the danger of the coronavirus early on because he did not want to “create a panic”.
With barely six weeks left before the election on November 3, Trump is behind Democratic rival Joe Biden nationally in every major opinion poll and is neck and neck in key swing states. Trump’s handling of the pandemic and subsequent economic downturn has battered his standing among many voters.
Trump has frequently questioned the advice of scientific experts on everything from the timing of a vaccine to reopening schools and businesses to wearing a mask. He has refused to support a national mask mandate and held large political rallies where few wore masks.
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield recently told Congress that a face mask would provide more guaranteed protection than a vaccine, which would only be broadly available by “late second quarter, third quarter 2021”.
Trump refuted the timeline for the vaccine and said it might be available in a matter of weeks and ahead of the November 3 election. On Friday he said he expected all Americans to have a vaccine by April.
Biden, who often wears a mask and has said he would require masks nationwide, has warned against a rushed release of a vaccine, saying, “Let me be clear: I trust vaccines, I trust scientists, but I don’t trust Donald Trump.”
The CDC currently predicts that the US death toll will reach as high as 218,000 by October 10.
The University of Washington’s health institute is forecasting coronavirus fatalities reaching 378,000 by the end of 2020, with the daily death toll skyrocketing to 3,000 per day in December.
Over 70 per cent of those in the US who have lost their lives to the virus were over the age of 65, according to CDC data
The southern states of Texas and Florida contributed the most deaths in the US in the past two weeks and were closely followed by California.
California, Texas and Florida — the three most populous US states — have recorded the most coronavirus infections and have long surpassed the state of New York, which was the epicentre of the outbreak in early 2020. The country as a whole is reporting over 40,000 new infections on average each day.
As it battles a second wave of infections, the US reported a 17 per cent increase in the number of new cases last week compared with the previous seven days, with deaths rising 7 per cent on an average, according to a Reuters analysis.
Six out of every 10,000 residents in the US have died of the virus, according to Reuters data, one of the highest rates among developed nations.
Brazil follows the US in the number of overall deaths due to the virus, with over 136,000 fatalities.",world
"Trump, Democrats on clash course over Supreme Court seat"," President Donald Trump and his adversaries mobilised on Sunday for an epic campaign-season showdown over the future of the Supreme Court even as the nation prepared to honour the life of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in an outdoor viewing to be held according to pandemic-era guidelines.
The President’s determination to confirm a replacement for Justice Ginsburg before the November 3 election set lawmakers on a collision course with one another at a time when Congress already has major issues on its agenda, including spending bills to keep the government open past next week and a stalled coronavirus relief package to help millions of Americans left unemployed by the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 people in the US.
Undaunted by the prospect of such a volatile fall, Trump prepared to announce a nominee as early as Tuesday in hopes of pressuring the Senate to ratify his choice before voters decide whether to give him a second term and spoke multiple times with senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. Even as a moderate Republican senator reaffirmed her opposition to such an accelerated timetable on Sunday, others like senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee fell in line and it appeared increasingly likely that Trump may get the votes to proceed, although there were a few holdouts still to be heard from.
The political manoeuvring took place even as the nation was mourning Justice Ginsburg, a champion of women’s rights and a hero to the left who died at age 87 on Friday night.  Former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Junior, the Democratic presidential challenger, on Sunday denounced Trump’s decision to move ahead with a nomination and appealed to the handful of moderate Senate Republicans to stop the President from making a lifetime appointment that would shift the balance of power on the nation’s highest court without waiting to see the results of the election.
“To jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power,” Biden said in a speech in Philadelphia, noting that Republicans refused to even consider President Barack Obama’s nominee after Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, citing the coming election. “

If Trump wins the race, Biden added, then the Senate should consider his choice. “But if I win the election, President Trump’s nomination should be withdrawn,” said Biden. 
“As the new President, I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg’s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate before a confirmation vote.”
A new poll showed that the American public agrees with him and opposes Trump’s plan to rush a new Justice onto the court. Of those surveyed by Reuters and Ipsos since Justice Ginsburg’s death, 62 per cent said her seat should be filled by the winner of the November election.
One reason Trump may feel differently is the possibility that he may not be that winner. Biden has consistently led the President in polls for months.
The White House hopes that a Supreme Court fight will make a difference when everything up until now has not, giving Republican voters who care about the courts, particularly those opposed to legal abortion, a reason to turn out for him despite any concerns about his handling of the coronavirus, the state of the economy or other issues.

Data hurdle to Europe operations: Facebook," Facebook has told Ireland’s high court it cannot see how its services could operate in the European Union if regulators freeze its data transfer mechanism, the Sunday Business Post reported, citing court documents seen by the paper.
The US social media giant last week said the Irish Data Protection Commission, its lead EU regulator, had made a preliminary decision that the mechanism Facebook uses to transfer data from the EU to the US “cannot in practice be used”.
Facebook requested and secured a temporary freeze on the order and a court review in the Irish high court, which is due to consider the issue in November.

In an affidavit submitted to the court to request that the order be frozen, Yvonne Cunnane, Facebook Ireland’s head of data protection and associate general counsel, said it was not clear how the company could continue providing services in the EU if the Irish order is enforced, the Sunday Business Post reported.
“It is not clear to (Facebook) how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,” the newspaper quoted the affidavit as saying.

The affidavit has not been made public, a high court spokesman said, and a Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
In a September 9 blog post that first confirmed the investigation by the Irish regulator, Facebook said it “relied on the mechanism in question — under what are known as standard contractual clauses — to transfer data to countries outside the EU and that a ban would have “a far-reaching effect on businesses that rely on SCCs”.
The Irish investigation follows a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in July on when SCCs can be used legally. The ruling was in response to EU concerns that the surveillance regime in the US might not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens when their personal data is sent to the US for commercial use.",world
TikTok: US deal to fight ‘fake history’," US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he supported a deal in principle that would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the US, even as it appeared to conflict with his earlier order for China’s ByteDance to divest the video app.
TikTok will be owned by a new company called TikTok Global and will have its headquarters in the US, possibly in Texas, Trump said. Oracle Corp will take a 12.5 per cent stake in TikTok Global and store all its US user data on its cloud to comply with US national security requirements, the companies said.
Retail giant Walmart said it would take a 7.5 per cent stake in TikTok Global. ByteDance, which retains 80 per cent stake, has agreed to create 25,000 new US jobs at TikTok, up from a little over 1,000 now. “I said, you know, do me a favour, could you put up $5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to the real history of our country, not the fake history,” Trump said on Saturday.

Taiwan wary of China’s wider threat," Two days of Chinese military aircraft approaching Taiwan demonstrate that Beijing is a threat to the entire region and have shown Taiwanese more clearly the true nature of China’s government, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Sunday.
Multiple Chinese aircraft flew across the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait and into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Friday and Saturday, causing Taiwan to scramble jets to intercept. China claims Taiwan as its own territory.
“These activities are no help to China’s international image, and what’s more have put Taiwan’s people even more on their guard, understanding even better the true nature of the Chinese communist regime,” Tsai said. “Other countries in the region also have a better understanding of the threat posed by China.… The Chinese communists must restrain themselves, and not provoke.”
Tsai said China’s recent activities were a threat broader than just to Taiwan. “China’s existence is indeed aggressive and will bring a definite threat.” ",world
US court halts WeChat ban," A US judge early on Sunday blocked the Donald Trump administration from requiring Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google to remove Chinese-owned WeChat for downloads by late Sunday.
US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said WeChat users who filed a lawsuit “have shown serious questions going to the merits of the First Amendment claim, the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiff’s favour”.
Her 22-page order added the prohibitions “burden substantially more speech than is necessary to serve the government’s significant interest in national security, especially given the lack of substitute channels for communication”.
On Friday, the US commerce department had issued an order citing national security to block the app from US app stores owned by Tencent Holdings and the justice department had urged Beeler not to block the order. Tencent and the justice department did not immediately comment.
Beeler’s preliminary injunction also blocked the commerce order that would have barred other transactions with WeChat in the US that could have dramatically degraded the site’s usability for current US users or potentially made it unusable. The US commerce department did not immediately comment.
WeChat has had an average of 19 million daily active users in the US, analytics firms Apptopia said in early August. It is popular among Chinese students, Americans living in China and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.
The justice department said blocking the order would “frustrate and displace the President’s determination of how best to address threats to national security”.
Beeler wrote “certainly the government’s overarching national-security interest is significant. But on this record — while the government has established that China’s activities raise significant national security concerns — it has put in little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all US users addresses those concerns”.
WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users. The justice department also argued that WeChat users could switch to other apps or platforms.
The WeChat Users Alliance praised the ruling “as an important and hard-fought victory” for “millions of WeChat users in the US”.
Michael Bien, a lawyer for the users, said “the United States has never shut down a major platform for communications, not even during war times. There are serious First Amendment problems with the WeChat ban, which targets the Chinese American community”.
He added the order “trampled on their First Amendment guaranteed freedoms to speak, to worship, to read and react to the press, and to organise and associate for numerous purposes”. Beeler also noted “there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices”.  ",world
"Fears over safety, Astra releases Covid vaccine blueprint"," AstraZeneca revealed details of its large coronavirus vaccine trials on Saturday, the third in a wave of rare disclosures by drug companies under pressure to be more transparent about how they are testing products that are the world’s best hope for ending the pandemic.
Experts have been particularly concerned about AstraZeneca’s vaccine trials, which began in April in Britain, because of the company’s refusal to provide details about serious neurological illnesses in two participants, both women, who received its experimental vaccine in Britain.
Those cases spurred the company to halt its trials twice, the second time earlier this month. The studies have resumed in Britain, Brazil, India and South Africa, but are still on pause in the US. About 18,000 people worldwide have received AstraZeneca’s vaccine so far.
AstraZeneca’s 111-page trial blueprint, known as a protocol, states that its goal is a vaccine with 50 per cent effectiveness. To determine with statistical confidence whether the company has met that target, there will have to be 150 people ill with confirmed coronavirus among participants who were vaccinated or received placebo shots.
However, the plan anticipates that a safety board will perform an early analysis after there have been just 75 cases. If the vaccine is 50 per cent effective at that point, it might be possible for the company to stop the trial early and apply for authorisation from the government to release the vaccine for emergency use.

Dr Eric Topol, a clinical trials expert at Scripps Research in San Diego, said AstraZeneca’s plan, like those of Moderna and Pfizer, had a problematic feature: All count relatively mild cases of Covid-19 when measuring efficacy, which may hamper efforts to determine whether the vaccine prevents moderate or severe illness.
Such plans are not usually shared with the public “due to the importance of maintaining confidentiality and integrity of trials”, Michele Meixell, a spokesperson for AstraZeneca, said in a statement.
The company has released few details about the two cases of serious illness in its trial. The first participant received one dose of the vaccine before developing inflammation of the spinal cord, known as transverse myelitis, according to a participant information sheet for AstraZeneca’s vaccine from July. The condition can cause weakness in the arms and legs, paralysis, pain and bowel and bladder problems.
The case prompted a pause in AstraZeneca’s vaccine trials to allow for a safety review by independent experts. A company spokesperson told The Times last week that the volunteer was later determined to have a previously undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, unrelated to the vaccine, and that the trial resumed shortly thereafter.
The company said it had not confirmed a diagnosis in the second case, a participant who got sick after the second dose of the vaccine. A person familiar with the situation who spoke with The Times on the condition of anonymity said the participant’s illness had been pinpointed as transverse myelitis. The trial was paused again on September 6 after she fell ill.
The condition is rare, but serious, and experts said that finding even one case among thousands of trial participants could be a red flag. Multiple confirmed cases, they said, could be enough to halt AstraZeneca’s vaccine bid entirely.
“If there are two cases, then this starts to look like a dangerous pattern,” said Mark Slifka, a vaccine expert at Oregon Health and Science University. “If a third case of neurological disease pops up in the vaccine group, then this vaccine may be done.”
The company’s chief executive told investors about the problems but did not discuss them publicly until the information was leaked and reported by the new website STAT. Dr Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the US Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee on vaccines, and other experts noted that transverse myelitis is rare, diagnosed in only about one in 236,000 Americans a year. The trial in Britain involved only about 8,000 volunteers.
If a serious side effect was definitively linked to AstraZeneca’s vaccine, scientists would need to determine if its root cause stemmed from the adenovirus vector it uses, or perhaps the coronavirus genes it carried.

Rajan plan to stem bad loan crisis," Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday suggested the government to privatise select public sector banks, set up a bad bank to deal with NPAs and dilute the role of Department of Financial Services.  
The reforms are necessary to ensure the growth of banking government without 
the periodic boom-bust cycles, said a paper titled “Indian Banks: A Time to Reform?” co-authored by Rajan and former Reserve Bank deputy governor Viral Acharya. 
“Re-privatisation of select PSBs can then be undertaken as part of a carefully calibrated strategy, bringing in private investors who have both financial expertise as well 
as technological expertise; corporate houses must be kept from acquiring significant stakes, given their natural conflicts of interest,” the paper said.

Noting that the government obtains enormous power from directing bank lending, it said sometimes this power is exercised to advance public goals such as financial inclusion or infrastructure finance, sometimes it is used to offer patronage to, or exercise control over, industrialists.     
“Winding down the department of financial services in the ministry of finance is essential, both as an affirmative signal of the intent to grant bank boards and management independence and as a commitment not to engage in “mission creep” when compulsions arise to use banks for serving costly social or political objectives,” the paper noted.",business
MP Birla trio oppose court order restraining Harsh Vardhan Lodha," Harsh Vardhan Lodha and three cable manufacturing companies of the MP Birla group filed appeals against the trial court order which restrained Lodha from holding any office in any group entity.
Sources say Birla Corporation, the flagship of the group, will also file an appeal on Tuesday and a hearing at the division bench could start from Wednesday. The Lodhas are seeking an interim stay on the operation of the order.
The legal setback to Lodha, who is the chairman of all group companies, appeared to have unsettled the investor community. On the first trading day after the single bench order was passed, all four listed companies came off sharply in an already weak market.

While the broader market shed a little over 2 per cent — Nifty 50 closed 2.21 per cent lower — the Birla Corp stock fell by 8.19 per cent. The cable companies — Universal Cable, Birla Cable and Vindhya Telelinks — also fared worse than the market, correcting 6.29 per cent, 3.76 per cent and 3.68 per cent, respectively. The appeal filed by Lodha and the three firms would revolve around what constitutes the controlling block of shares in the manufacturing companies. According to the submission made on Monday, Lodha would argue that the estate of late Priyamvada Devi Birla, was only a minority shareholder in the companies.
The estate, which is now governed by a committee of administrator pendente lite (APL committee), is one of the many shareholders of the larger promoter group, his counsel would argue before the division bench.
Sources in the Lodha camp pointed out that estate is conclusively defined by the inventory of assets unanimously prepared by joint administrators and produced in court in 2013.
Harsh Lodha — whose father late Rajendra Singh Lodha was handed the reign of MP Birla group in 2004 by a contentious will of late Priyamvada Birla — in his submission is also going to point out that despite the trial court acknowledging its limitation on jurisdiction over companies, it ordered all such promoter group entities to exercise voting rights in line with the direction of the APL committee. 
“The verdict seeks to change the composition of independent trust and societies run by trustees and managing committees by removing a member without giving any of them any hearing,” a source in the Lodha camp argued. Such entities hold over 14 per cent in Birla Corp. Birla camp had a different take. It argued that the controlling block of share — 62.9 per cent in Birla Corp — is part of the estate, a view taken by the single bench as well. 
The Birlas also contested that the inventory of the estate drawn up in 2013 is not full and final, noting that the Lodhas have made at least four submissions before the court seeking direction to prepare a final list.
“How come Lodha is now in control of the MP Birla group today? It is because he had stepped into the shoes of his father R.S. Lodha, who was the executor of late Priyamvada Birla’s will. Today, the APL Committee is in her shoes,” said a Birla source.",business
Bengal excise duty worry for liquor makers," Two industry bodies representing major foreign liquor manufacturers in the country have written to the Bengal government to make changes to a proposed excise duty structure for liquor in the state or delay its implementation in the current year.
The state had planned to bring in the new structure from September 2020 and had sought the industry’s opinion on setting the excise duties based on ex-distillery prices along with data on comparative prices of other states. But following requests from the industry for additional time to gather more data, the implementation has been deferred. 
The industry has estimated that the new structure, where there are 22 slabs of additional excise duty based on ex-distillery price, would inflate the cost of foreign liquor in the state by 40-90 per cent over those prevailing in March 2020.

In its representation to the state, the International Spirits and Wines Association of India and the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies have requested that the additional excise duty slabs be cut from 22 to 12, bringing in parity with neighbouring states and thwart the spread of spurious liquor.
Diageo-USL, Pernod Ricard, ABD Limited, Radico Khaitan, Beam Suntory, Bacardi, Moet Hennessey, Brown-Forman, William Grant, Campari and Mohan Meakin are part of these associations.
While the government has proposed that suppliers can charge 10 per cent higher than the lowest ex-distillery price, the associations want the state to consider this at 30 per cent and make the prices valid for a period of 12 months only. 
As an alternative the associations have also urged the government to consider the proposal of deferring the implementation of the new tax structure in 2020-21.
According to the associations, when most states are rationalising taxes (Odisha, Delhi) in order to bring MRP at such levels that revenue is maximised, Bengal has proposed a tax structure which will take MRPs even higher. They have estimated a 40-45 per cent drop in volume and 25 per cent shortfall in revenue if the proposed taxation structure is implemented in its current shape and form.
Sources however said that the government is not primarily in favour of deferring the rollout of the new tax structure any further, but would have to carefully weigh any revenue loss in the process.",business
Telcos to pay 10% of AGR dues by March," Telecom operators, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which have pending adjusted gross revenue dues will have to pay 10 per cent of the total liability by March 31 irrespective of the part-payments made by them, according to government sources.
Operational telecom operators are expected to pay Rs 12,921 crore by March 31, of which around 80 per cent have to be paid by Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel.  
“The Supreme Court order is very clear that telecom operators have to make 10 per cent payment of the total dues as demanded by the DoT by March 31, 2021.

“The DoT has already raised demand for full AGR dues. The 10 per cent payment to be made by this March will be calculated on the total AGR liability,” a DoT official said. 
The officer said operators can clear the balance dues in 10 yearly instalments from the next financial year. According to the officer, Vodafone Idea will have to pay around Rs 5,825 crore and Bharti Airtel Rs 4,398 crore against the total demand of Rs 58,254 crore and Rs 43,980 crore, respectively.

Mahindra & Mahindra mulls Ssangyong stake bid," Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is understood to be considering a $258 million (300 billion won) bid for its stake in Ssangyong Motor Company (SYMC) made by HAAH Automotive Holdings Inc, a US-based automobile distributor. Mahindra holds almost 75 per cent in the South Korean auto maker.
In August this year, M&M decided to reduce its stake in SYMC to less than 50 per cent even as the company indicated that it was open to the possibility of ceding control over SYMC in full or part. 
This was to induct potential investors into SYMC or to otherwise meet its funding requirements through other sources.

According to M&M’s annual report for 2019-20, as of March 31 2020 its investments in SYMC stood at Rs 2,450 crore, while its ownership interest was at 74.65 per cent. 
Shares of M&M on Monday settled almost five per cent lower on the bourses. 
On the BSE, it ended at Rs 622.35 — a drop of 32.10, or 4.90 per cent, over its last close. 
M&M was recently in news when the company said that it has terminated share purchase agreement with CLP India to sell the entire stake held by its step down arm Mahindra Renewables in Neo Solren Pvt Ltd (NSPL) for Rs 104.67 crore.",business
Dalmia OCL to invest Rs 100 crore to step up local production," Dalmia OCL, the refractory manufacturing arm of cement and sugar major Dalmia group, plans to invest Rs 100 crore over the next five years in a bid to step up indigenous production in India and bring down dependance on imports, especially from China.
Refractories are used in furnaces and kilns primarily in the steel and cement industry. At present, around 40 per cent of India’s requirement is met through imports. 
In a bid to de-risk and localise, Dalmia OCL on Monday announced the opening up of a 1.08-lakh-tonne brownfield capacity at Rajgangpur in Odisha to manufacture magnesia carbon refractory bricks. Phase 1 of the plant with a capacity of 36,000 tonnes has come up at an investment of Rs 20 crore. Two more phases would be added over the coming years. 
“Current investment has been Rs 20 crore and we will be investing Rs 100 crore over the next 3-5 years to expand refractory manufacturing,” said Sameer Nagpal, CEO, Dalmia OCL.
The investment decision comes on the back of demand from the steel industry to localise the production of refractories in India amid rising geopolitical tension. Steel constitutes around 70 per cent of the refractory demand followed by cement at around 10-12 per cent and glass, non-ferrous metals and petrochemicals among the other sectors.
The primary reason for import has been the incremental cost of manufacturing which is 5-7 per cent lower in China mainly due to their cost competitiveness. But with adequate handholding from the domestic industry and government, Dalmia OCL expects the cost in India can be brought down over the next 6-12 months.
""It is important to do the initial hand holding by the customers. Some of them are demanding supply from India. Because of the momentum we have accelerated the setting up of capacity in India. We are also in discussion with the government on how to make domestic manufacturing more competitive,” Nagpal said. Tax benefits, production linked incentives, import duty changes and thrust on mining and exploration could speed up capacity expansion, he added.
The company has 5 plants in India in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh besides one plant each in Germany and China. Nagpal said that the company has spent more than Rs 100 crore in acquiring a German firm that will give access to crucial technology in the sector.",business
Government must pick tab for waivers: Rajiv Mehershi panel," The Rajiv Mehershi panel on loan recast has proposed the government should bear the burden of any relief while the waiver of the contentious interest on interest be given only to a few borrowers, sources said.
The report on the impact of the waiver of interest and the waiver of interest on interest, or compound interest, on loan moratorium has indicated banks are a financial intermediary and have a responsibility to their depositors. The government appointed panel is under ex CAG Rajiv Mehrishi.
The panel has suggested the government should bear the burden and the sovereign should compensate the banks if relief has to be given.
Given the huge burden of interest on interest faced by borrowers, the government can limit the waiver to the the most vulnerable segments such as affordable housing, MSMEs and smaller education loans.
The committee has indicated a complete waiver of compound interes would tantamount to punishing the good borrowers for paying their loans on time.
The Mehrishi committee  has reportedly arrived at a compound interest sum of around Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore and the sovereign should bear the burden if they be waived.
Brokerage firm Macquarie had estimated that interest waiver will cost the banking system about Rs 2.1 lakh crore while waiver of compound interest will cost about Rs 15,000 crore.
The ministry of finance had set up this three-member expert committee on September 10, comprising former CAG Rajiv Mehrishi, former monetary policy committee member Ravindra H Dholakia and the former managing director of SBI and IDBI Bank B Sriram.
The report of the committee would assist the government in the assessment of providing relief to the bank borrowers on the issue of banks charging interest on loan installments deferred during the moratorium period due to the coronavirus pandemic.",business
SBI charges 0.35% extra for loan recast," State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday announced the details of its resolution framework to restructure Covid-19 related stress loans. 
Corporate borrowers will have to provide a personal guarantee of the promoters or a pledge of their shares. 
Individuals seeking a restructuring of their loans will have to pay an additional interest of 0.35 per cent annually over and above the current pricing for the remaining tenure of the loan though they will not be subject to any processing fee.
The country’s largest bank also launched a facility on its website to help retail customers check their eligibility for the one-time loan restructuring.
Last month, the RBI had announced a one-time restructuring scheme for personal loans and corporate borrowers affected by the pandemic. This will apply to only those accounts that existed in banks’  books as on March 1, 2020. Another crucial condition is that the accounts should be standard (performing) and also not in default for more than 30 days as on March 1, 2020.
SBI managing director (retail & digital banking) C. S. Setty said while retail customers can check their eligibility, if found eligible they will have to visit the respective branches to complete the other formalities such as the signing of papers. 
As of now, around 3,500 retail customers of the bank have accessed the portal and of them 111 are eligible and have got their reference number generated, he said.
The bank’s retail customer will be asked to fill his or her account number in the relevant segment on its website. After the completion of OTP validation and keying in the requisite information, customers will get to know their eligibility and receive a reference number. This reference number will be valid for 30 days and within which time customers can visit the branch to complete the required formalities. 
An  individual borrower will be considered as affected by the Covid-19 pandemic if his or her salary in August 2020 got reduced  compared with February 2020, or there is a reduction/suspension in salary during the lockdown period. The individual can get home and other related loans, education, auto and personal loans restructured. The tenure of the loan can be extended for maximum 24 months under the framework for Covid -19 related stress.
The restructuring process will be complete after the verification of documents and execution of simple documents at the branch or the processing centre. Once an application is submitted, it will be processed within 7-10 working days.
The customer will have to upload or submit documents like salary slips for the month of February and latest salary slip apart from a declaration of estimated salary or income immediately after the end of the desired moratorium period (maximum 24 months) or a letter of discharge from job in case of job loss.
However, customers whose application has been accepted will be required to pay additional interest of 0.35 per cent per annum over and above their current pricing for the remaining tenure of the loan. SBI said that this is to offset partial cost of additional provisions required to be made.
For non-personal borrowers, SBI said that in case of unlisted entities, personal guarantee of the promoters will have to be furnished and for listed companies, promoters will have to pledge their shares. In these cases, a processing fee or upfront fee of 0.25 per cent of the `aggregate limits’ will be payable. SBI added that for loans with aggregate exposure of Rs 1500 crore and above from the banking system, last date for submitting application is November 15 and for others, the last date to apply for relief under the November 30.",business

Stocks collapse on fresh virus scare," Wall Street’s main indices tumbled to their lowest in nearly seven weeks on Monday, with the Dow shedding as much as 900 points, as worries about fresh coronavirus-driven lockdowns spilled over from Europe. Back home, the Sensex crashed 812 points, while the Nifty finished below the 11300-mark.
While the selloff was in line with global trends, investor wealth worth Rs 4.23 lakh crore was wiped off. 
Investors were jittery following reports of Denmark, Greece and Spain imposing fresh restrictions on activities to tackle a surge in Covid-19 infections even as Britain was considering a second nation-wide lockdown.
The 30-share Sensex opened lower at 38812.69 and fell below the 38000-mark to hit a day’s low of 37938.53. It finally ended 811.68 points, or 2.09 per cent, lower at 38034,14, falling for the third straight session. The broader Nifty cracked 254.40 points, or 2.21 per cent, to finish at 11250.55.
“The markets sold off in a major way because of several factors such as reports about irregular financial dealings involving some of the major international banks and fears of a second-wave of pandemic in many parts of Europe. With the markets having run ahead of the economy, it is only probable that there will be higher level of volatility,’’ said Joseph Thomas, head of research,  Emkay Wealth Management. 
In the Sensex pack IndusInd Bank was the top loser as it fell 8.67 per cent, followed by Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, M&M, Maruti, Axis Bank and Bajaj Finance. Only three stocks ended in the green -- Kotak Bank, Infosys and TCS, rising up to 0.86 per cent.
Meanwhile, shares of Route Mobile made a strong debut as they jumped 86 per cent at close of trade against its issue price of Rs 350. On the BSE, it got listed at Rs 708, reflecting a jump of 102.28 per cent from the issue price. During the day,it rose to a high of Rs 735, registering a gain of 110 per cent. It later closed at Rs 651.10, higher by 86 per cent.",business
Trai issues spectrum usage charges sop," In a relief to operators, the telecom regulator has said spectrum usage charges (SUC) will be levied only on the shared spectrum band and not on all the bands of a licensee.
Regulator Trai clarified that in cases involving the sharing of radiowaves, the stipulated increment of 0.5 per cent on the SUC rate should apply only on the spectrum held in the specific band where sharing is taking place and not on the entire spectrum holding of the licensee.
The telecom regulator has also recommended that suitable exit clauses for the termination of existing spectrum-sharing arrangement by the operators be included in the spectrum sharing guidelines. 
ADVERTISING

At present, companies pay 3-5 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue  as spectrum usage charge to the department of telecom.
If they share spectrum with another operator, operators must pay an additional 0.5 per cent of AGR for that band as SUC. 
The recommendations are the outcome of a consultation paper titled “Methodology of applying spectrum usage charges under the weighted average method of SUC assessment in cases of spectrum sharing” that was floated by Trai in April this year.
At present, companies pay 3-5 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as spectrum usage charge to the department of telecom. If they share spectrum with another operator, operators must pay an additional 0.5 per cent of AGR for that band as SUC. 
In January, the telecom department had said the existing norms for sharing of access spectrum by operators provide that the SUC rate of each of the licencees post sharing increases by 0.5 per cent of the AGR.
The Department of Telecom (DoT) also informed that it has received representations requesting that incremental SUC rate of 0.5 per cent post sharing should be applied only to the particular spectrum band which has been allowed to be shared between the two licencees and not on the entire spectrum held by licencees, since sharing is allowed in a particular band.
It is in this background that DoT requested Trai to furnish its recommendations on whether the incremental 0.5 per cent in SUC rate in cases of sharing of spectrum should be applied only on the specific band in which sharing is taking place; or on the overall Weighted Average Rate of SUC, which has been derived from all bands.
The two prominent spectrum sharing arrangements were between Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Communications for the 800 MHz spectrum owned by the latter, and Tata Teleservices sharing its spectrum in 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz in around half a dozen circles with Bharti Airtel.
While Reliance Jio acquired some spectrum in the 800-Mhz from Reliance Communications before it shut shop, Bharti Airtel acquired all the spectrum along with the entire consumer mobile business of the Tata group.",business

“We are getting details of it. We’ll examine it and respond to it as appropriate. Prima facie it does look frivolous as we believe we have been transparent in our disclosure,” the spokesperson added.
“Rosen Law Firm is preparing a securities lawsuit on behalf of HDFC Bank shareholders,” the global investor right law firm said on its website.
Citing some news reports about alleged unfair business practices and that the lender had missed analysts’ estimates on profits for the first quarter ended June 30, Rosen Law Firm said it was preparing a securities lawsuit. 
The reports related to the private sector lender conducting a probe into the allegations of improper lending practices and conflicts of interests in its vehicle-financing operations involving the unit’s former head.
The HDFC Bank American depository receipt share price fell 2.83 per cent following the report, it added. 
The law firm said it will investigate “potential securities claims on behalf of the shareholders of HDFC Bank Ltd resulting from allegations that the bank may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public”.
Last year, Rosen Law had prepared a similar class-action suit against Infosys after a whistleblower had alleged malpractices by a few key management personnel. The suit was dismissed in May this year. “If you purchased securities of HDFC Bank please visit the firm’s website...to join the securities action,” Rosen Law Firm said.
Last month, HDFC Bank had launched a probe on its vehicle finance lending practices following allegations against the conduct of a key executive in the auto lending business. However, the bank said that this probe will not have any bearing on the loan book, or will not cause any loss to the bank.
Speaking to shareholders at its annual general meeting, Aditya Puri, HDFC Bank managing director and CEO, had said that the bank had received a whistleblower complaint and subsequently, it conducted an internal investigation into the auto loan business. Following this, the bank had taken action against some employees.
Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation, according to its website.
Shares of HDFC Bank on Monday ended marginally lower at Rs 1033.55.
The largest Indian private sector lender had posted a 22 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 6,927 crore in the April-June quarter of current financial year 2020-21.",business
RBI's recap skip call," The government may not have to inject fresh capital into the public sector banks (PSBs) as the one-time loan restructuring permitted by the RBI has reduced additional fund requirement by them.
Also the poor credit offtake on account of the coronavirus pandemic may obliterate the need for significant growth capital during the current fiscal, sources said.
There may not be a sudden surge in non-performing assets (NPAs) after the six-month moratorium comes to an end this month as it is followed by a one-time loan restructuring, sources said, adding, provisioning requirement is also quite low for the debt recast accounts.
Moreover, most of the public sector banks have taken approval in advance to raise tier-I and tier-II capital during the current fiscal depending on the need.
Despite all these, sources said, if at all there is a need for regulatory capital requirement by some public sector banks towards the end of the current fiscal, the government will provide that like it has done in the past.
In 2019-20, the government infused Rs 70,000 crore into PSBs to boost credit to give  a strong impetus to the economy.
However, the government refrained from committing any capital in Union Budget 2020-21 for the PSBs, hoping that the lenders will raise funds from the market depending on the requirement.",business
Rush for gold funds," Gold ETFs witnessed an inflow of Rs 921 crore in July, a surge of 86 per cent from the preceding month, as new investors rushed to add the precious metal in their portfolios in view of higher prices.
With this, the net inflow in the gold exchange traded fund, or ETF category, has reached to Rs 4,452 crore in the first seven months of the year, data with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed.
According to the data, a net sum of Rs 921 crore was pumped into gold-linked ETFs last month, higher than the net Rs 494 crore in June.
The inflows meant assets under management (AUM) of gold ETFs climbed 19 per cent to Rs 12,941 crore at the end of July from Rs 10,857 crore in June-end.
Month-wise, investors put in a net Rs 202 crore in January, Rs 1,483 crore in February, but withdrew Rs 195 crore in March on profit-booking.
Inflows resumed in April at Rs 731 crore, followed by Rs 815 crore in May.
“Gold prices continued to scale new highs on the back of weakness in the dollar, tension between the US and China and consistent rise in Covid-19 cases globally, which boosted its safe-haven appeal,” said Himanshu Srivastava, associate director-manager research at  Morningstar India.
“With all major economies staring at recession due to the spread of coronavirus pandemic, gold, expectedly, has emerged as one of the best performing asset classes and a preferred investment destination among investors,” he added.
Srivastava further said the surge in coronavirus cases has cast a doubt on the swift recovery hopes and investors continue to hedge their exposure to riskier assets by investing a portion of their assets in gold, as it is seen as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.",business
Industry felt impact in last fiscal," As many as 159 companies listed on the BSE cumulatively saw a decline of Rs 22,538 crore in their EBITDA in the three months ended March 2020 compared with the December quarter, reflecting an early impact of the coronavirus pandemic, says a report. 
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
For the report, leading consultancy EY India analysed March quarter results of the top 300 BSE-listed companies and 115 global firms spanning over 12 sectors to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 disruptions on their reporting calendar, profitability, financial position, liquidity, disclosures and other key parameters.
“The analysis relies on the details of the pandemic’s impact as presented by companies in their results or any public document pertaining to their quarterly reporting,” EY India said.
It was done for the March quarter results of top BSE 300 companies that were announced till June 5.     
Most of the companies experienced a material impact on financial performance indicators such as EBITDA, revenue, debt and interest service coverage, provisions, profitability as and earnings per share (EPS), it noted.
According to the report, 159 BSE 300 companies saw Rs 22,538 crore decrease in EBITDA in the March 2020 quarter compared to the preceding December quarter, 2019 “as early impacts of pandemic and resulting changes in macro-economic factors,” EY India said.
Sectors that experienced significant negative influence of the pandemic and unfavourable macro-economic changes were BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) aviation, automotive, power, oil & gas and travel, the report noted.",business
SUV appeal endures during pandemic," SUVs are blazing the roads amid the debris of the pandemic.
As many as 12 of the 18 models launched since March have been SUVs or SUV bodytypes, braving a downturn in the market that is consistently reporting falling sales month-on-month.
Car makers have lined up another 27 models by the end of the calendar year — of which 15 will be SUVs, taking the number of planned launches to 27 in just nine months.
The industry, on the other hand, continues to be sucked into the vortex of a slump  with July sales down over 30 per cent. Manufacturers, however, have taken it on their chin as they lure customers with fresh launches every month.
Analysts said consumers are downgrading their choices with the contraction in the economy and falling incomes. “But once the pandemic is over, people will go back to their preferred vehicle, that is the SUV,” an analyst said.
Shashank Srivastava, executive director, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, pointed out the markedly different type of SUVs favoured by the buyers.
“In India, SUVs have a different connotation altogether. It is not the 4x4 offroader that is the choice of the consumers here,” he said.
“Rather it is the urban SUV, a 2x2 avatar with SUV bodystyle that is favoured. And why just India, SUV bodystyle is the choice all over Europe, China too,” Srivastava said. Maruti has the S-Presso, Ignis, XL6 with an SUV-ish design.
For Hyundai, it is the SUV that is giving the company its numbers. The new Creta launched in March has garnered 65,000 bookings with 60 per cent of  the sales coming from the diesel variant.
Tarun Garg, director (sales, marketing & service), Hyundai Motor India Ltd,  said, “Hyundai Creta has redefined the SUV landscape since its launch in 2015 and has crossed 5-lakh sales mark.”
Hyundai sold more than 34,000 units of the Creta, Venue, Tucson and  Kona Electric. The Korean company has products in all the segments, including the hatchback and sedan, but is betting big on its SUV range because of its high profitability, Garg said. 
Toyota Kirloskar India Limited (TKIM), which is poised to launch its first compact SUV Urban Cruiser this month, is seeing a revival at the lower end of the market.
“The market composition is veering towards what it was five years ago with compact cars seeing a revival of sales,” said Naveen Soni, senior vice-president, sales and service, Toyota Kirloskar.
The Japanese  company is witnessing a growth in the lower end of its product range with the Glanza comprising 25 per cent of its sales. Both the Glanza and the upcoming model Urban Cruiser are cross-badged vehicles from Maruti.
“In a contracting industry, Glanza has been able to hold on to its sales of 2,000 units per month. We think the Urban Cruiser, an A segment SUV, will be a good enabler in the current market,” Soni said.
For Tata Motors, it’s the compact SUV and the premium hatchback that are seeing good numbers. “The number of first time car buyers is very high in the market. Also people are buying additional cars preferring personal mobility to mass transit. These first time buyers are opting for compact SUVs or premium hatches priced Rs 5 lakh upwards. The segment below Rs 10 lakh is growing,” said Vivek Srivatsa, head of marketing, passenger vehicle business unit, Tata Motors.
Kia Motors, which had a dream debut with the SUV Seltos in the top 10 bestselling list every month, will have its compact SUV Sonet in the market in September. The other entrant to the market, MG Motors, has launched its six-seater Hector Plus and is gearing up to launch the MG GS.",business
NBFCs suffer from cash flow mismatch," Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) could face a cash flow mismatch with the Reserve Bank of India allowing a one-way restructuring of advances, a senior industry representative said.
NBFCs are concerned over falling cash inflows following the moratorium to its clients even as they repay the banks for their borrowings which are not under moratorium.
Sunil Kanoria, vice-chairman, Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd, said the proposed restructuring programme was designed without any consultation with the industry. “NBFCs are not manufacturers of goods; they borrow money from banks and from the wholesale market,” Kanoria said.
Since NBFCs have been directed to offer moratorium to their clients and are expected to restructure the loans of their customers, it is only fair that they should be allowed to get their borrowings restructured, Kanoria said, adding “otherwise, it will create serious mismatch in their cash flows”.
He said a representation has been made to the RBI requesting the regulator to address the anomaly of the cash flows to ensure the financial stability of the NBFC ecosystem.
Kanoria said a loan should be restructured after assessing the financial position and future cash flow of the borrower and should not be restrained with timelines and portfolio sizes.
While announcing the one-time restructuring of MSMEs, the RBI has fixed the aggregate exposure of the borrower at Rs 25 crore as on March 1, 2020 and mandated the restructuring to be done by March 31, 2021.
“If deadlines have to be set, it should be liberal, till at least March 2022. We should also wait for the expert committee, led by K.V. Kamath, to make suggestions,” Kanoria said.
He said some large NBFCs backed by the government may be able to steer their operations through the pandemic, but others would have to work out strategies.
Many NBFCs, including Srei, have been selling portfolios and banks flush with liquidity have been the major buyers.
Despite the challenges, deepened by the IL&FS defaults and overall risk aversion from the banking sector, the borrowings of the NBFC sector from the banks have shown an uptrend. RBI data show that the share of long-term market debt in the total borrowings of the NBFC sector has declined from 49.1 per cent at the end of March 2018 to 40.8 per cent at the end of December 2019.
The funding gap was met through bank borrowings that rose from 23.1 per cent to 28.9 per cent over this period.
Kanoria said that while a consolidation of NBFCs may not be an ideal solution, the regulator can encourage mergers between banks and systemically large NBFCs.
“It has happened in the past and there are success stories from such mergers. This will provide a long-term solution to the current liquidity conundrum for NBFCs and will help in expanding the reach of banking services to larger numbers of SME and MSME customers,” he said.",business
Gas price may fall below $2," Prices of natural gas in India are likely to be cut to $1.9-1.94 — the lowest in more than a decade — from October, denting the revenues of producers such as ONGC who are already incurring huge losses on production.
A price revision is due from October 1 and going by the changes in the benchmark rate in gas exporting nations, the price is likely to be anywhere between $1.90 and $1.94 per million British thermal unit (mBtu), sources privy to the development said.
This will be the third straight reduction in rates in one year. Prices were cut by a steep 26 per cent to $2.39 per mBtu in April.
Prices of natural gas, which is used to produce fertiliser and generate electricity and is also converted into CNG for use in automobiles as fuel and cooking gas for households, are set every six months — on April 1 and October 1 each year.
Sources said the cut in prices would mean a widening of losses for India’s top oil and gas producer ONGC.
Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had posted a Rs 4,272-crore loss in its gas business in 2017-18, which is likely to widen to over Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), they said.
ONGC has been incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic metres per day of gas it produces from domestic fields soon after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula.",business
Vistara set to fly abroad," Private carrier Vistara is likely to start flight operations between India and the UK, Germany and France under the bilateral air bubble arrangements that have been signed with these countries, sources in the aviation industry said on Sunday.
Earlier this month, India and the UK signed a bilateral air pact, under which the airlines of both the countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions. India had signed similar bilateral pacts with Germany and France in July.
Vistara got its second B787-9 wide-bodied aircraft on Saturday. It had received its first B787-9 aircraft in February.
“Vistara has already got the slots at the Heathrow airport in London. The flights between Delhi and London are likely to be announced in the next few days,” an industry source said.
The Delhi-London flight is likely to operate thrice a week, the source added.

A wide-bodied aircraft has a bigger fuel tank that allows it to operate long-haul flights. Vistara has 43 planes in its fleet, of which 41 are narrow-bodied aircraft such as A320neo and B737-800NG.
The full-service carrier is also likely to operate flights between India and Germany and India and France, another aviation industry source said, adding that the probable destinations for these flights are Frankfurt and Paris respectively.
It is not clear which Indian cities will be connected to Frankfurt and Paris by Vistara. The private carrier did not respond to the queries.
Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The aviation sector has been significantly impacted because of the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the pandemic.
All airlines in India have opted for cost-reducing measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firing of employees in order to conserve cash.
India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25 after a gap of two months. The airlines have been allowed to operate a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights. However, the occupancy rate in the domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.",business
"Brace for hard times, warns Kumar Mangalam Birla"," Kumar Mangalam Birla has said the country’s GDP may not only contract in 2020-21 but the next few years are also likely to be characterised by difficult conditions even as there could be other post-Covid changes reflected in consumer behaviour and the operating models of companies.
Birla, who is one of the country’s leading industrialists with diversified interests ranging from commodities and telecom to financial services, said in a letter to shareholders that while the domestic economy may witness its first contraction in more than four decades in this fiscal, some scars from the current pandemic would last longer for the world economy in the form of subdued consumer and business confidence.
Some sectors, such as airlines and hospitality, will take time to recover fully, while some supply chain disruption effects will linger.
He pointed out that as the world emerges from the current crisis, the next few years are likely to be marked by a lack of buoyancy in growth, subdued commodity prices and inflation, a cautious trend in project investments, heightened risks of de-globalisation and political uncertainty; and increased dependence of financial systems on ultra-loose monetary policy conditions.
“We will also have to watch out for potential post-Covid changes in consumer behaviour (such as more virtual engagements) and of the operating models of organisations (such as work-from-home norms, diversification of supply chain risks, more use of e-commerce),” he added.

Birla, thus, joins the list of several economists who are forecasting a challenging year for India with recovery only expected next fiscal. While experts feel that the Indian economy may show a double-digit contraction in the first quarter of the fiscal with some estimates even putting it at over 40 per cent and that for the year as a whole, it may shrink by over five per cent.
According to Birla, Covid-19 struck India at a time the underlying economic conditions were subdued on account of heightened global uncertainty and stress in the domestic financial system. A stringent national lockdown to slow the spread of the pandemic started in the last week of 2019-20 and remained active in varying degrees in different geographies through most of the first quarter of 2020-21.
“It is estimated that about 80 per cent of India’s GDP originates from districts which were classified under the red and orange zones during the lockdown, where economic activity remained severely constrained,” he said.
The Aditya Birla group chairman added that though the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have taken various measures to stabilise the economy and boost growth, the Indian economy — like the global economy —will still need to navigate through some difficult quarters.
Given the fog of uncertainty all around, it is hard to be prescient in these times, Birla added. Steel demand is expected to decline significantly in 2020-21 in line with a projected contraction in the global economy due to the impact of coronavirus pandemic, Tata Steel has said in its annual report.
Most of the steel producing regions are expected to witness a decline in crude steel output due to production cuts amid the ongoing lockdowns, Tata Steel said.
The global economic growth is expected to see a contraction of over 3 per cent in 2020, Tata Steel chairman N. Chandrasekaran said, terming the slump as the “worst contraction” since the 1930s.
A contraction in global GDP is not a good sign for the steel sector as steel demand is positively correlated with the economic growth.
“Global GDP growth eased to 2.9 per cent in 2019 against an initial growth projection of 3.5 per cent... As we look ahead, it is important to gauge Covid-19’s unprecedented impact on the global economy. It is expected that global growth will contract by over 3 per cent in 2020, the worst contraction since the 1930s,"" Chandrasekaran said in the Annual Report for 2019-20.
“But there is little doubt on one reality: companies with quality leadership, sound business fundamentals and a track record of winning in turbulent times, will emerge as champions in the new global order,” he said.
This year will see an economic contraction, but this 2020 recession is turning out very different from the past recessions, he observed.
Birla was, however, quick to add that on the positive side, this recession is likely to be one of the shortest, assuming no second wave of the pandemic recurs. As present lockdowns around the world get lifted, and businesses reopen, economic activity is likely to bounce back fairly quickly.",business
Gold is on a roll," Since the beginning of 2019, one asset class has emerged the clear winner. It’s gold. Ten grams of 24k gold cost around Rs 32,500 in January 2019. Since then, there’s been a nearly 70 per cent appreciation, with gold future prices appreciating to over Rs 57,400. Gold had flatlined for nearly a decade.
But global economic uncertainty started driving it up again before the explosive growth with the arrival of a global pandemic. The pandemic continues to disrupt daily life and economic adversities continue to compound in many economies. It is expected that gold will continue to do well in the near future. So what should the small investor do? Gold thrives in economic uncertainty. During those periods, while everything else crashes and burns, gold shines. Investors use it as a hedge against uncertainty, volatility and inflation. To them, gold is insurance. If global stock indices are crashing, you may be able to stabilise your portfolio through gains in gold. With fiat currencies becoming less valuable in developed countries, people’s faith in the metal may continue to increase.
According to Goldman Sachs, a weakening dollar and falling interest rates could push gold prices up from the current $1,930 per ounce levels to around $2,300 in the next 12 months.
Others see it going higher. “Gold has entered a bullish phase that can last several years,” said The Arora Report.
“There is better than 50 per cent probability of gold approaching $3,000 in this cycle.”
Jefferies believes it could rise to $4,000. Clearly, there’s a belief that prevalent instabilities will keep driving up prices. Investors who had been buying gold through the recent past have gained immensely from the ongoing rally. But for new investors looking to get in, the growth prospects are unclear. Therein lie the risks and rewards. You can invest according to your risk appetite to cash in on short-term trends.
However, from a long-term perspective, it would be wiser to buy small quantities of gold regularly and systematically. For example, you could buy a gram every month for several years. This would slowly help you create a gold corpus while lowering price-related risks. By the time another global economic crisis comes along, the gold you have slowly accumulated will give you stability. The key with buying gold is having just enough to stabilise your portfolio during times of volatility but not so much as to drag your wealth growth during periods of prosperity. In ten-year periods starting August 1980 and ending August 2010, gold grew at approximate annual rates of -5.20 per cent, -2.63 per cent, and 15.85 per cent considering absolute prices.
In the 10 years since then, it grew at 4.61 per cent. Between August 2012 and August 2018, it flatlined at -0.2 per cent. Over the next two years, it would grow at 32 per cent.
The point here is that gold flatlines for long periods of time but can grow in short, explosive bursts. If you have too much, you may not achieve growth for prolonged periods. If you have too little, it will not make a meaningful impact on your portfolio during periods of volatility.
Many experts believe gold should constitute 5-10 per cent of a portfolio. This is a useful yardstick. However, you can pick a number based on your own unique situation after assessing your risk appetite, investment goals, and liquidity needs. The obvious and traditional choice is to buy gold in its physical form, be it jewellery, coins, bars or something else. You could buy them from your preferred shop or even online via reputable sellers. This option is also useful from the point of using the gold.
However, you need to factor in making charges, applicable taxes, concerns over purity, and costs of safe storage into your investment objectives.
If you’re looking at gold purely as an investment, you must also consider buying gold exchange-traded funds, gold mutual funds or Sovereign Gold Bonds.
ETFs and MFs can be easily bought online from the fund house of your choice, while the SGBs can be bought several times a year from authorised banks, stock exchanges, or online trading platforms.
As a long-term investment, the SGB scores over other options because of sovereign guarantee, tax-free returns on maturity, and an additional interest income on the price which is the icing on the cake. You could also buy or sell digital gold through authorised payment apps.
In conclusion, while the investment opportunity in the coveted yellow metal may seem hard to overlook, one must approach the decision-making process in a pragmatic manner — both in terms of investment amount and investment mode.

ICICI raises Rs 15000cr through QIP issue," ICICI Bank, the country’s second-largest private sector lender, on Saturday said it has raised Rs 15,000 crore through qualified institutional placement (QIP) after completing the allotment of equity shares under the offering.
The proceeds from the issue will be used to strengthen the capital adequacy ratio of the bank and improve its competitive positioning or general corporate requirements. Investors were allocated 41.89 crore shares at an issue price of Rs 358 per share.
“The issue price represents a 1.9 per cent premium to the floor price determined based on the pricing formula as prescribed under Regulation 176(1) of the Sebi ICDR Regulations and a discount of 1.5 per cent to the closing price of the bank’s equity shares on the BSE/NSE prior to the launch of the issue,” ICICI Bank said in a statement.
Earlier this week, the bank had set a floor price at Rs 351.36 per share for the offering. The issue opened on August 10 and closed on August 14.
Following the allotment of shares, the paid-up equity share capital of the bank has increased to Rs 13,790,821,242 consisting of 6,895,410,621 equity shares of face value Rs 2 each from Rs 12,952,832,416 consisting of 6,476,416,208 equity shares of face value Rs 2 each, ICICI Bank said.

During the share sale, the Monetary Authority of Singapore picked up 4.6 crore shares, representing 11.06 per cent of the QIP size. Other prominent investors included Morgan Stanley Global Opportunity Fund and Societe Generale-ODI, picking up 7.31 per cent and 5.55 per cent, respectively.
The equity issuance also witnessed healthy participation from global and domestic investors, including foreign portfolio investors, domestic mutual funds and insurance companies, the lender said.
With the latest fund raise, ICICI Bank has joined a group of lenders, including the nation’s largest housing finance company HDFC, which raised more than Rs 14,000 crore last week. Others like Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have also raised capital as the system braces for a loan impairment impact because of the Covid-19 crisis. 
It is feared that the banking system could see a rise in bad loans during the second half of this fiscal as the relaxations given by the Reserve Bank of India come to an end.
The central bank has also been asking lenders to beef up their capital in advance, expecting a rise in NPAs.
ICICI Bank said that it is well-positioned to serve the market and benefit from the opportunities that would arise going forward. In these extraordinary times of the coronavirus pandemic, the bank will continue to strive to serve its customers and also emerge stronger as an institution, it added.",business
Not liable to pay Reliance Communications dues: Jio," Reliance Jio’s four-year-old telecom spectrum sharing deal with Reliance Communications (R-Com) is not connected to the latter’s past statutory dues that pertain to the period prior to 2016 when Jio wasn’t even in operation, sources close to the company said. 
A Supreme Court bench had on Friday sought to know why Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) must not pay the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of R-Com as it has been using the latter’s spectrum since 2016. 
A source, refusing to be quoted as the matter is sub-judice, said RJIL in April 2016 entered into a pact to share a part of the spectrum held by R-Com and its unit Reliance Telecom. 
The shared spectrum was limited to the 800MHz band and was strictly in accordance with the department of telecom’s (DoT) spectrum sharing guidelines. R-Com’s 2G, 3G and 4G spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band are not being shared. 
The AGR dues of R-Com and RTL are in no manner connected with this shared spectrum, the source said, adding that the AGR has been paid by both R-Com/RTL and RJIL on the revenue generated from the shared spectrum.

Jaguar Land Rover bailout talks with UK government fails," Bailout talks between Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel with the UK government have ended, leaving both firms to rely on private financing to overcome the impact of coronavirus on business, the Financial Times reported on Friday.
The report here said that talks for an emergency funding fell through as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) did not qualify for taxpayer support. It is the luxury car unit of India’s Tata Motors and Tata Steel, both owned by Indian conglomerate Tata Group.
The bailout plan, titled “Project Birch”, had been authorised by finance minister Rishi Sunak in May to rescue companies that are seen as strategically important, with the Treasury saying it may step in to support crucial businesses on a “last resort” basis after other options run out.
The report, citing a source familiar with the matter, said that the funding scheme became infeasible for Tata as it imposed strict conditions on any lending.
“Tata Steel remains in ongoing and constructive talks with the UK government on areas of potential support,” Tata Steel said in an emailed statement.
The UK Treasury said it would not comment on individual companies. Tata Motors did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Ongoing trade conflicts and Covid-19 has adversely impacted JLR vehicle sales in 2019-20, which contracted by 12 per cent year-on-year. 
A significant part of the volume decline occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019-20. 
JLR was able to improve its profitability during the year and reduce its cash outflows, compared with previous years despite a decrease in volumes through a host of structural initiatives to drive efficiencies. ",business
Top taxmen can order raids," Only the director-general of income tax (investigation) and the chief commissioner for income tax (TDS) can approve I-T raids and all communications from the department to the taxpayer, assessee and any third party will be in the name of the National e-Assessment Center (NeAC).
In an order, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has said the officers posted in directorates of investigation and commissionerates of TDS, “only and exclusively” shall act as “income tax authority” for raids under section 133A of the Income Tax Act.
“The competent authority for approval of such survey action u/s 133A of the Act shall henceforth be DGIT (Inv) for investigation wing and Pr. CCIT/CCIT (TDS) for TDS charges, as the case may be,” said the order.
Noted tax expert Narayan Jain said: “The decision of the CBDT in taking away powers of survey for jurisdictional officers, the joint CITs and CITs is a step in the right direction. 
“In many cases, they used to conduct survey and obtain confession under pressure to meet collection targets. The survey powers of the investigating wing should be used sparingly and they must act in a fair manner. The TDS authorities have limited powers of survey and they should act within that. The TDS official cannot impound books of account or computer records.”
Under section 133A of the Income Tax Act, an income-tax officer or any authorised inspector of income tax can enter any place within the limits of the area assigned to him, or any place occupied by a person who falls under an officer’s jurisdiction or at a location where business or profession is carried on, for tax surveys and raids. 
The officer concerned may also inspect books of account or other documents as he may require and which may be available at such a place.
The issue of alleged tax harassment by officers gained much attention after V.G. Siddharta, the founder of Cafe Coffee Day, committed suicide and left behind a note accusing tax authorities of persecuting him.
The income tax department has embarked on the journey of faceless tax administration. Further, the CBDT has notified the National e-Assessment Centre (NeAC) in Delhi and various Regional e-Assessment Centres (ReACs) across 20 cities in the country for implementation of the scheme.
The CBDT has now given the detailed guidelines for the implementation of the scheme and role of residual charges.
Shailesh Kumar, partner, Nangia & Co LLP, said: “This detailed internal guidance note by the CBDT has clarified that apart from assessment proceedings, a large number of other functions such as rectification proceedings, demand collection management, tax recovery proceedings, proceedings to give effect to appellate orders, etc. shall remain with the field officers.” ",business
Hindalco in the red after 18 quarters," Hindalco Industries has reported its first loss in 18 quarters as volumes fell after the coronavirus lockdown disrupted economic activities. 
Net loss of the billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s company stood at Rs 40 crore in the June quarter compared with a Rs 23-crore profit a year ago, according to an exchange filing on Friday. That’s the first loss since the third quarter of 2015-16. 
On a consolidated basis, the company posted a loss of Rs 709 crore for the quarter. It had posted a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 1,063 crore in the April-June quarter a year ago. 
Hindalco said that “Q1 consolidated PAT for continuing businesses before tax-effected exceptional and special items stood at Rs 139 crore”.
The Aditya Birla Group firm in a statement said  “on account of certain special items, including charitable contributions towards COVID relief, ex-gratia paid to employees for their contribution during COVID, and Aleris acquisition costs, the reported PAT was impacted”. Indian Bank on Friday posted the first result after amalgamation of Allahabad Bank in April. The Chennai-based lender reported a net profit of Rs 369 crore for the June quarter of 2020 against Rs 492 crore a year ago for the combined entity. 
On a standalone basis, however, net profit of Indian Bank was Rs 365 crore during the April-June quarter of 2019-20, reflecting a marginal rise.
The bank’s net interest income grew 17 per cent to Rs 3,874 crore during the quarter against Rs 3,316 crore a year ago. Net interest margin was 2.83 per cent.
“The key parameters of income, cost efficiency and profitability have improved both year on year and quarter on quarter. Asset quality has improved,” said Indian Bank chief executive Padmaja Chunduru. 
“The Bank has made upfront provisions in two accounts and also contingency provisions for Covid-19. The accounts under moratorium constitute above 23 per cent and there is very good progress being made on the collection front, month on month,” said Chunduru.
“The amalgamation is going on track and we expect to complete it in the current financial year,"" she added.
The bank is also looking to unlock value in two of its subsidiaries - Ind Bank Merchant Banking Services and Ind Bank Housing and will also explore the rationalisation of unviable and slow growth branches.",business
Auditor to GVK Power offers to quit," Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP wants to resign as the statutory auditors of GVK Power as it says the group is not providing them with the necessary information for audit of the financial statements for 2019-20.
On August 13, the auditors had in a letter to the company’s audit committee said their decision to resign would be “effective immediately upon discharge of their obligations” under the Companies Act, 2013 read with Sebi circular in October 2019, GVK Power told  bourses on Friday.
GVK Airport Holdings, a subsidiary of GVK Power, is the parent company of Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), holding more than 50 per cent stake. The other stakeholders in MIAL are Bidvest, ACSA and the Airports Authority of India. Earlier, Bidvest had entered into an agreement with the Adanis to sell its entire stake in the airport for Rs 1,248 crore. 
The Adanis had also offered to buy out ACSA at a similar price. However, its plans hit a roadblock. There have also been reports of the GVK group raising over Rs 7,500 crore from an investor.
The auditors, who were appointed for a term of five years in September 2017, alleged that despite several communications to the audit committee and the management since July 3, with regard to audit of financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020, which is under progress, necessary information was not provided to conclude the audit.

India returns to $4.83bn trade deficit in July," The country returned to a trade deficit of $4.83 billion in July, a month after a rare trade surplus in over 18 years, as imports increased, showing signs of a pick-up in business activity.
Exports, contracting for the fifth straight month, slipped 10.21 per cent to $23.64 billion in July, on account of decline in the shipments of petroleum, leather and gems and jewellery items, according to government data released on Friday.
The country’s imports, too, dipped 28.4 per cent to $28.47 billion in July, leaving a trade deficit of $4.83 billion compared with a shortfall of $13.43 billion a year ago.
The outward shipments in July, however, recovered from a steeper decline of 60.28 per cent in April, 36.47 per cent in May, and 12.41 per cent in June.
Fieo president Sharad Kumar Saraf said, “All this has been possible because of the start of business activities across the country and enquiries from almost all major economies which has helped to bring exports to almost 90 per cent of the July 2019 level.” The wholesale price-based inflation continued to remain in the negative zone for the fourth straight month at 0.58 per cent even as the prices of vegetables and other food items were costlier.
WPI inflation in June was (-) 1.81 per cent, while for the month of May and April it was (-) 3.37 per cent and (-) 1.57 per cent, respectively. Retail inflation, however, rose to 6.93 per cent in July from 6.23 per cent in the preceding month.
""The annual rate of inflation, based on monthly WPI (Wholesale Price Index), stood at (- 0.58 per cent) (provisional) for the month of July, 2020 as compared to 1.17 per cent during the corresponding month of the previous year,"" the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement.
In contrast, the data released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday showed that retail inflation accelerated to 6.93% in July from 6.23% in the preceding month, with food inflation rising to 9.62% from the June level of 8.72%.
Saraf, however, said the global revival and business sentiments still have not picked up, impacting the global supply chain. The government focus should be on FTAs and more of multilateral agreements to further revive our exports and take up competition coming from smaller countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and Taiwan.
Aditi Nayar, principal economist with ICRA said “the rare trade surplus seen in June 2020 predictability vanished with some recovery in merchandise imports in July 2020, which stamped out the further improvement in merchandise exports. This trend is likely to strengthen in the coming months, as demand for non-oil non-gold imports starts to normalise, gold imports gather steam around the festive/marriage months, and crude oil demand and prices stabilise at a moderate level.”
“Merchandise imports had lagged the extent of recovery shown by many high frequency indicators in Q1 FY2021. With the imports of some diverse categories of goods recovering in July 2020 relative to the previous month, such as petroleum products, gold, project goods, electronic goods etc., domestic demand appears to be emanating from the lockdown-induced torpor,” she added.
EEPC India chairman Mahesh Desai said “engineering exports are amongst a handful of sectors which managed to post a positive trend of 8.6 percent growth as global demand for essential metals and other related items have started to bounce back. However, with resurgence of cases in several parts of the world, it would be difficult to say whether the positive trend can be sustained going forward.
“
The oil imports declined by 31.97 per cent to $ 6.53 billion in the month under review and gold imports grew by 4.17 per cent to $1.8 billion.
During the April-July period, exports declined by 30.21 per cent to $74.96 billion, while imports fell 46.7 per cent to $ 88.91 billion. Trade deficit during the period stood at $13.95 billion.
New Delhi: The wholesale price-based inflation continued to remain in the negative zone for the fourth straight month at 0.58 percent even as the prices of vegetables and other food items were costlier.
WPI inflation in June was (-) 1.81 per cent, while for the month of May and April it was (-) 3.37 per cent and (-) 1.57 per cent respectively.
""The annual rate of inflation, based on monthly WPI (Wholesale Price Index), stood at (- 0.58 per cent) (provisional) for the month of July, 2020 as compared to 1.17 per cent during the corresponding month of the previous year,"" the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement.
In contrast, the data released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday showed that retail inflation accelerated to 6.93% in July from 6.23% in the preceding month, with food inflation rising to 9.62% from the June level of 8.72%.
Inflation in food articles was at a four-month high level of 4.08 per cent in July, mainly due to sharp rise in vegetable prices. Inflation in vegetables stood at 8.20 per cent, against (-) 9.21 per cent in June.
Pulses saw inflation of 10.24 per cent, while for potatoes it was 69.07 per cent in July. Protein rich items like egg, meat and fish saw hardening of prices with inflation at 5.27 per cent. However, onion prices softened and inflation fell 25.56 per cent, while in fruits it was (-) 3.03 per cent.
Inflation in the fuel and power basket fell 9.84 per cent in July, compared to 13.60 per cent drop in the previous month. Manufactured products, however, witnessed inflation of 0.51 per cent in July, against 0.08 per cent in June.
Analysts said the difference in weightage assigned to different goods/items that make up the two baskets.
In CPI, food has a much higher weightage than in the wholesale basket. So, a rise in food prices will cause a bigger spike in the CPI basket than in the WPI one. Similarly, manufactured goods are given more weightage in the wholesale basket. Therefore, any movement in the price of such items will move the WPI more than it does the CPI. While WPI does not include services, the retail price index does, which impacts final numbers.
Madan Sabnavis, chief economist with Care Ratings said weightage assigned to different components is one of the factors behind the varying trend between WPI and CPI. Another is that retail inflation takes into account services, which has gone up sharply and pushes up the CPI numbers. Retail margins higher for food due to more intermediaries.
“One of the key reasons for subdued wholesale inflation is the depressed prices of manufactured items. Manufactured items have 64.2 % weight in the wholesale price index. The average inflation witnessed in the manufactured items during the past twelve months is -0.1% due to the weak demand conditions in the economy,” Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings said.
He said “the wholesale and retail inflation though paint a contrasting picture and policy prescription, the nominal anchor for RBI is retail inflation.
The retail inflation in combination with recent industrial production data makes the emerging scenario even more complex due to the divergence in trend.
While the industrial production data may support further easing of policy rate, retail inflation breaching RBI’s upper band of 6% in seven out of the last eight months may suggest otherwise. Ind-Ra believes RBI will watch inflation trajectory very carefully and in the interim would continue with the accommodative policy stance but pause on further rate cuts.”
The RBI in its policy review last week kept interest rates unchanged and said it sees an upside risk to inflation. The apex bank projected retail inflation to moderate in October-March period.",business
Flipkart to deliver alcohol in Bengal and Odisha," Walmart-owned Flipkart has teamed up with Diageo-backed HipBar to deliver alcohol in Bengal and Odisha. The development comes after Flipkart’s rival Amazon had in June received approval to deliver liquor in Bengal. 
Flipkart and Amazon’s interest in delivering alcohol in India marks a bold move to make inroads into an alcohol market that is worth $27.2 billion, according to estimates by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.
The local governments of Bengal and Odisha have said that Flipkart can be associated as a technology service provider of Diageo-backed HipBar, an Indian alcohol home delivery mobile application.
Flipkart’s customers will  have access to HipBar’s application. HipBar will then deliver the order after collecting the products from retail outlets. Amazon.com on Friday launched an online pharmacy in Bangalore. The service, Amazon Pharmacy, has begun and will soon offer deliveries across the city, Amazon said. It offers both over-the-counter and prescription-based drugs. ",business
Wider radar to stop tax dodge," In a move to widen the tax base and plug evasion, the government plans to bring transactions such as hotel bills over Rs 20,000, education fee of over Rs 1 lakh and purchase of jewellery, white goods, marble or painting over Rs 1 lakh under the scanner of the income tax department.
The government has proposed to expand the list of reported transactions to include domestic business class air travel or foreign travel, cash deposit of Rs 10 lakh or more in non-current accounts, sale of foreign exchange above Rs 10 lakh, payment of property tax above Rs 20,000 per year, life insurance premium above Rs 50,000 and health insurance premium above Rs 20,000, mygov.in said in a tweet on Thursday which has been subsequently removed.
As part of the multiple reforms to improve tax compliance, faceless assessment and the ease of filing returns, the government has proposed to reduce the threshold of various transactions for tax disclosure.
Tax experts said to bring more transactions under the scanner would require an amendment of the Income Tax Act. Section 285A is an enabling section, which empowers the CBDT to prescribe various transactions for reporting to the I-T department.
Noted tax advocate Narayan Jain said, “This has been done with the objective of widening the tax base but monetary limits need to be revisited and should be reasonably increased so that compliance becomes easier. In the case of financial transactions or payments above Rs 50,000 and up to Rs 2 lakh, furnishing of PAN should be enough.”
“Taxpayers claim deduction for medical insurance  and life insurance premium. So, it may be illusory to cover the same for the purpose of reporting or for mentioning in Form 26AS. Again, in most of the cases, the property tax paid is  claimed as deduction for computing income from house property. The taxpayer charter assured of minimising compliance cost but these reporting measures are likely to substantially increase the compliance cost,” he added.
The government has also proposed to deduct TDS at higher rates for those who do not file income tax returns. There is also a proposal for compulsory filing of ITR by those having bank transactions above Rs 30 lakh, all professionals and businesses having turnover of more than Rs 50 lakh and payment of rent above Rs 40,000.
More transactional categories in the reporting imply an enhanced flow of information to tax authorities, but will put the onus on taxpayers to comply voluntarily. When implemented, it will also be reflected in Form 26AS, the consolidated annual statement showing tax deductions/ collections and advance tax against an individual’s PAN.",business
DoT claims on Reliance Communications contested," State Bank of India, the lead banker of the committee of creditors which is overseeing the bankruptcy resolution process at Reliance Communications (R-Com), has virtually tried to repudiate the Centre’s claim to roughly Rs 25,000 crore worth of unpaid telecom licence fee dues of the former Anil Ambani-owned company.
Creditor banks had steered R-Com into the insolvency process in May 2019, ostensibly giving it a cloak of protection against operational creditors, including the department of telecom (DoT).
The DoT has been pressing hard to realise Rs 1.47 lakh crore in pending telecom dues from 15 mobile telephony licence holders, many of whom have already hit the wall and no longer offer services.
On Friday, Harish Salve, lead counsel for R-Com’s committee of creditors, argued that the telecom company’s financial creditors like the banks and financial institutions had the first claim to any payout by the telecom company under the terms of the insolvency process. Operational creditors like DoT would simply have to wait.
Salve told the court that the CoC had “complete autonomy to decide who gets how much”. In several IBC cases, operational creditors have received next to nothing as the financial creditors pounced on the assets of the bankrupt firms.
“Operational creditors (like DoT) cannot be paid on a par with the financial creditors,” Salve told the court during the hearing.
Salve went on to add that SBI believed that the spectrum that had been leased to R-Com for 20 years had to be treated as an asset of the telecom companies — a line of argument that the Centre has consistently challenged on the grounds of Constitutional privileges that confer rights to all resources in the country, including radio waves on the sovereign.
The R-Com spectrum has been farmed out to Reliance Jio under a spectrum sharing deal in 2016.
The apex court bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra, S. Abdul Nazeer and M.R. Shah wanted to know the details of the spectrum sharing pact and asked why Jio could not be asked to pay the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) related telecom dues on behalf of R-Com.
“Jio needs to explain why we should not catch hold of you to pay the AGR dues. By sharing R-Com revenue, you (Jio) have gained revenue... this is revenue sharing. 
If Jio is using public assets like spectrum, why should Jio not be liable to pay the AGR dues.” 
“We want details of spectrum sharing agreements entered into by all insolvent companies. We want to know who is using the spectrum of the insolvent companies,” the bench said while adjourning the matter till August 17 (Monday).
The bench asked the DoT to submit the documents certifying all spectrum sharing arrangements.
Senior advocate Shyam Divan, who appeared for the resolution professional appointed to look after the day-to-day affairs at R-Com, said the government had been informed about the spectrum sharing agreement in 2016 and relevant fees paid.
“When the sovereign right is transferred to the telco for using spectrum, can the dues arising become subservient to the dues claimed by secured creditors?” Justice Mishra observed. 
“There is a need to ensure that the IBC is not misused by companies to escape liabilities,” the bench said.
We can lay down the law if required for the IBC process. Dues arising out of the use of natural, public resources cannot be (treated as) merely operational dues, a matter of public money,” Justice Mishra observed.
On July 2, the apex court had agreed to consider a staggered payment schedule for the long-pending AGR dues of the telecom companies. But before it passed its verdict, the court had sought clarity on the insolvency claims made by R-COm, Videcom and Shyam Sistema Teleservices.
The court wanted the other insolvent telecom companies like Aircel and Shyam Sistema to also come out with details of their spectrum sharing agreements, if any, with other players.",business
System of faceless tax appeals will come into force from Sept 25," Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a transparent tax platform and said the system of faceless tax appeals would come into force from September 25. 
Modi also rolled out a taxpayers’ charter, which outlines the rights and responsibilities of both the tax officers and taxpayers. Analysts said the charter had laid out the principles only and must be supplemented by administrative orders.
The Centre has been pushing for a system to break down the interface between the tax officials and taxpayers. It has already started the system of faceless tax scrutiny — and the latest measures mark a step forward.
Mukesh Butani, managing partner at BMR Legal Advocates, said, “The tax statutes need an amendment to curtail the discretionary powers of the field officials because that has predominantly contributed to the current situation. The faceless assessment and appeal scheme shall act as a restriction on individual discretion, which in my view has caused the most damage with regard to harassment.”
The issue of alleged tax harassment by officers gained much attention after V.G. Siddharta, the founder of Cafe Coffee Day, committed suicide and left behind a note accusing the tax authorities of persecuting him.
Under the faceless appeal  system, the appeals will be randomly allotted to any officer in the country. The identification of the officers deciding the appeal will remain unknown, and  the taxpayer will not be required to visit the income tax office or the officer. The appellate decision will be team-based and reviewed.
The exceptions to the  system include serious frauds, major tax evasion, sensitive and search matters. The system also excludes international taxation and the Black Money Act and the Benami Property Transactions Act.
Noted tax advocate Narayan Jain said “faceless assessments and appeals will remove the necessity of the personal appearance of taxpayers or their representatives. However, officials need to be fair and objective and decide the matters judiciously”.
Sudhir Kapadia, national tax leader at EY India, said, “As an immediate relief, it would be highly desirable if the CBDT instructs the release of all pending refunds to companies as quite a few companies are left with no choice but to consider approaching courts to expedite their refunds in this pandemic-induced stressful business environment.”
The income tax department has issued refunds worth Rs 71,229 crore in over 21.24 lakh cases till July 11, the finance ministry has said.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has issued income tax refunds of Rs 24,603 crore in 19.79 lakh cases to individual taxpayers and corporate tax refunds of Rs 46,626 crore in 1.45 lakh cases to companies and all refund-related cleaning up of tax demands is being taken up on priority and is likely to be completed by August 31, the finance ministry has said. .
Through the charter document, the government has committed the following to the taxpayers: To provide fair, courteous and reasonable treatment; Treat taxpayer as honest; To provide mechanism for appeal and review; To provide complete and accurate information; To provide timely decisions; To collect the correct amount of tax; To respect privacy of taxpayers; To maintain confidentiality; To hold its authorities accountable; To enable representative of choice; To provide mechanism to lodge complaint; To provide a fair and just system; To publish service standards and report periodically; and  To reduce cost of compliance.
The taxpayer charter also highlights the obligations of the taxpayer like To be honest and compliant; To be informed; To keep accurate records; To know what your representative does on your behalf; To respond in time; and To pay in time.
“The rights provided to the taxpayers through this charter intends to bring more clarity and provide good practices to the administration against providing stringent requirements in the income tax legislation with detailed mechanisms and processes to deal with breach of legal right. It may nevertheless be possible for taxpayers to seek its implementation contending that it ought to be binding on the administrating officers,” Kumarmanglam Vijay, partner, J. Sagar Associates, said.
 Shailesh Kumar, Partner, Nangia & Co LLP said “the Taxpayer's Charter in its present form intends to bring qualitative change in the way Income Tax department functions and two administrative orders limiting interaction between tax officials and taxpayers has been issued immediately after release of Taxpayer's Charter. We can see similar administrative orders in coming days to further streamline the processes and to improve taxpayers' experience with the income tax department. The same may include fixing timelines on completion of proceedings, processing various applications filed by taxpayers, issuance of refunds in addition to timelines already prescribed in the Income tax act. Presently, the Taxpayer's Charter is more on principle and setting the overall theme, which will be supplemented by administrative orders to be issued by the CBDT in times to come,” he added.
Jain also said that under section 115BBE, aggregate tax is as much as 78 per cent from assessment year 2017-18. During demonetisation in December 2016 the rate was increased from 30 per cent to 75 per cent plus education cess. He demanded that the rate should be brought back to 30 per cent. The tax rates and Tax laws have to be fair and reasonable to ensure proper tax compliance, added Jain.",business
Retail inflation simmers at 6.93%," India’s retail inflation rose to 6.93 per cent  in July on higher food prices, remaining above the RBI’s medium-term target for the 10th straight month, according to government data released on Thursday.
July’s figure was higher than the 6.23 per cent recorded in June.
Food prices soared because of supply-side disruptions caused by the coronavirus lockdown. They rose 9.62 per cent compared with a jump of 8.72  per cent in June.
The steady rise in coronavirus cases has disrupted the supply chain as lockdowns continue at regional levels.
Fearing a sharp rise in inflation, the RBI last week kept interest rates on hold, after reducing the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February. The RBI has set its medium term inflation target at 4 per cent.

The economy is expected to contract more than 4.5 per cent in the current fiscal year, but some analysts do not expect the central bank to cut rates further this year.
“Given the distortions in supply chains and transportation, I don’t expect a rate cut in the remaining part of 2020,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, economist at L&T Financial Holdings.
M. Govinda Rao, chief economic adviser of Brickwork Ratings, said: “CPI inflation rose in July despite fewer supply-side constraints following the relaxation of lockdown. We expect food inflation to soften in the coming months with easing supply constraints and better monsoon so far. However, the core inflation may remain at elevated levels as the demand picks up, but capacity utilisation does not increase.”
Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist, India Ratings said: “MPC will watch inflation trajectory very carefully before taking decisions on rate cuts.”
“The evolving trends suggest that the CPI inflation may remain appreciably above 6 per cent in August 2020, which would be the last inflation print available before the next MPC review. Accordingly, the likelihood that the MPC would persist with a pause in its October 2020 meeting has climbed sharply, with a final rate cut likely to be deferred to the December 2020 or February 2021 meeting,” Aditi Nayar, principal economist of ICRA, said.
Monsoon rains are expected to be 104 per cent of the long-term average in August and September, indicating bumper harvests and helping to alleviate some of the damage caused by the pandemic.
However, hopes rest on the monsoon spread which are expected to be 104 per cent of a long-term average in August and September, indicating bumper harvests and helping to alleviate some of the economic damage caused by the pandemic.
The government suspended the release of CPI inflation headline numbers for April and May due to insufficient data during the lockdown.
The RBI kept interest rates on hold last week after reducing the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February - despite a recent rise in retail consumer prices - but said it would ensure inflation remains within target.
It is for the second consecutive month that the retail inflation has been above the RBI's comfort level. The government has mandated the central bank to restrict the inflation at 4 percent (+, - 2 per cent). The central bank mainly factors in retail inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy.",business
H-1B visa: exemptions to ease travel restrictions," The US state department on Wednesday released a set of exemptions that will ease travel restrictions that were clamped on H-1B visa holders in June though there were some lingering concerns over certain caveats in the guidance note.
In a proclamation issued two months ago, President Donald Trump suspended work visas across H-1B, L and J categories, sparking concern in the country’s technology industry.
The latest guidance note says healthcare professionals and researchers travelling on a request supported by a US government agency or an entity to meet critical US foreign policy objectives will be allowed to travel to the US on these visas.
The government has also allowed travel by applicants seeking to resume ongoing employment in the United States in the same position with the same employer and visa classification.
Travel by technical specialists, senior-level managers and other workers whose travel is necessary to facilitate the economic recovery of the United States has also been permitted.
Industry body Nasscom said it was cautiously optimistic about the exemptions but added that the guidelines still allow a lot of leeway in its interpretation. “The exceptions include potential exemptions for technology workers on H-1B/L-1 visas providing critical infrastructure services, a key ask by Nasscom and the Indian tech industry,” Nasscom said in a statement on Thursday.
The association noted that it also includes exceptions for H-1B/L-1 visa-holders who would be returning to the US in the same position with the same employer and visa classification.
Nasscom said it has consistently raised the importance of visa holders working in the tech sector, particularly those who would be delivering services designated essential as per the DHS CISA ‘Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce’.
It raised the importance of particularly those who would be returning to the US in the same position with the same employer and visa classification.
Nasscom welcomed the move saying this will help US businesses access talent critical to the economic recovery phase in the post-COVID world.
“However, we remain ‘cautiously optimistic’ as caveats in the DoS guidance about seniority, unique and significant contributions and/or other factors that go along with the exceptions still allow a lot of leeway in interpretation of the new guidance. The impact can only be gauged in course of time,” it added.
Nasscom emphasised that this is a step in the right direction and encouraged the implementing agencies to ensure that American businesses’ access to critical talent is not hampered.
US President Donald Trump, in his June proclamation, had banned the entry into the US of workers in several key non-immigrant visa categories, including the H-1B, arguing that they eat into American jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.",business
Royal Dutch Shell ready to board Nayara," Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy has received a major boost in its petrochemical plans with Royal Dutch Shell likely to buy a 50 per cent stake in the proposed project.
Nayara, formerly Essar Oil, operates a 20-million-tonne refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat apart from a network of 5,700 retail fuel outlets.
In January 2019, the company had announced that it is working on a milestone development programme for its Vadinar refinery and that the first stage involves a foray into the Indian petrochemical market.
It had then disclosed that the first phase of the programme includes construction of units to provide for production of up to 450,000 tonnes of polypropylene per annum. The project is to be completed in 2022.
The preliminary cumulative investments for the first phase was put at $850 million. Nayara had then said that the programme will be funded through internal accruals and bank financing.
Subsequently, there were reports that it was looking to expand the capacity of the Vadinar refinery and set up a petrochemical complex with a capacity of around 10.75 lakh tonnes.
On Wednesday, Reuters had reported that Royal Dutch Shell is planning to buy a 50 per cent stake in the proposed petrochemical project of Nayara. Quoting sources, the report said that the petrochemical joint venture between the two entities was discussed at the meeting of the board of directors of Nayara in November and December last year.
The entire project, which will be completed in five years, will have a 1.8-million-tonne ethylene cracker and linked downstream units and the total cost would be around $9 billion.
At present, Nayara owns and operates India’s second largest single site refinery at Vadinar. The refinery has a Nelson complexity of 11.8, which is among the highest globally which enables it to process the toughest of the crudes.
Observers said that the interest shown by Shell in Nayara’s petrochemical complex reflects the potential of the Indian market and bodes well for domestic giant Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
RIL has been betting aggressively on petrochemicals. In November last year, it confirmed plans to invest Rs 70,000 crore to establish a crude oil-to-chemicals complex at the company’s Jamnagar facility. It also commissioned a refinery off-gas cracker in January 2019 at the same site with 1.5-million-tonnes ethylene capacity.

Titagarh Wagons in private train bid," Titagarh Wagons is open to opportunities to diversify which are emerging from Indian Railways’ move to invite private players to operate passenger train services.
The city-based rolling stock maker plans to keep its options open both as a supplier of rolling stock as well as explore strategic alliances to expand business in the services space as an operator.
According to Umesh Chowdhary, vice-chairman and managing director of Titagarh Wagons, the decision of the railways to invite private operators and improve the services in the passenger segment is a move that was long overdue as the freight sector already has seen private participation.
“Globally, we have seen that railways provide infrastructure and trains are operated by different players. This decision of Indian Railways will revolutionise the passenger movement,” Chowdhary told The Telegraph. He added that private operators will bring in competition and efficiency and further improve the passenger experience.
“At present, we are primarily a rolling stock manufacturer. It is an opportunity for us in many ways — whether as an operator or as a rolling stock manufacturer. It is too early to predict how this will take shape, but we are keeping our options open,” said Chowdhary.
Titagarh Wagons is among the 23 companies that have expressed interest in operating private trains as a service provider. Alstom, BEML, Bharat Forge, Bhel, Bombardier and  GMR are among the other operators who have shown interest.
Railways in July had said that it is seeking private participation in operation of passenger train services in over 109 origin-destination pairs of routes through introduction of 151 modern rakes that will be in addition to the existing trains operated on the network.

Limit on core investment companies," The RBI on Thursday tightened its rules on core investment companies (CICs) when it curtailed the number of layers of such entities in a group and directed them to make more disclosures. The RBI accepted the proposals of a panel under former corporate affairs secretary Tapan Ray, which had submitted its report in November 2018.
A CIC is a non-banking finance company (NBFC) which carries on the business of the acquisition of shares and securities and holds not less than 90 per cent of its net assets in the form of investment in equity shares, preference shares, bonds, debentures, debt or loans in group companies.
The Tapan Ray-panel had observed that the Companies’ Act 2013 restricted the group structure to a maximum of three layers, with one CIC at the top which could hold investments in step-down entities. However, NBFCs were exempted from this provision, which facilitated the proliferation of multiple layers of CICs in a group with cross-holdings.
The RBI said the number of layers of CICs in a group should now be restricted to two, irrespective of the extent of direct or indirect holding or control exercised by a CIC in the other CIC.
The RBI also strengthened the risk management at CICs as it looked to curb excessive leveraging.
It said parent CIC in the group or CIC with the largest asset size, if there is no identifiable parent CIC in the group, will form a Group Risk Management Committee.
The RBI added that if a CIC makes any direct or indirect equity investment in another CIC, it will be deemed as a layer for the investing CIC.
In cases where there are more than two layers in a group, the apex bank said that they will have time till March 2023 to reorganise their business structure and adhere to this guideline.
The RBI also strengthened the risk management at CICs as it looked to curb excessive leveraging. It said parent CIC in the group or CIC with the largest asset size, if there is no identifiable parent CIC in the group, will form a ""Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC)"".",business
Tata Steel deep in red," Tata Steel on Thursday reported a sharply higher loss than anticipated by analysts for the quarter ended June 30 as the Covid-19 pandemic hit demand. The steel major posted a consolidated loss of Rs 4,609 crore compared with a net profit of Rs 695 crore in the same period of the previous year.
Analysts were expecting Tata Steel to post a net loss of around Rs 2,400 crore.
The loss came as total revenues slid to Rs 24,288.51 crore from Rs 35,947.11 crore in the year-ago period.
The effect of coronavirus and the resulting global lockdown was reflected in its operations with production falling to 4.93 million tonnes from 6.34 million tonnes in the same period of the previous year.
Tata Steel disclosed that the average steel realisations in India were lower because of the Covid-19 impact during the quarter and about Rs 2,000 crore of costs were under-absorbed because of the lower volumes.
The performance of Tata Steel Europe was also affected because of the overall weakness in economic activities in Europe and a sharp drop in spreads. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) on Thursday reported nearly doubling of net profit in the June quarter after inventory gains offset a decline in refining margins and fuel sales.
The standalone net profit in April-June stood at Rs 2,076.17 crore compared with Rs 1,075.12 crore a year back.
The company earned $0.39 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel compared with a gross refining margin $2.81 a barrel a year ago in the same period of the previous year.
Fuel sales in the quarter that saw economic activity coming to a halt due to nationwide COVID-19 lockdown slipped to 7.53 million tonnes when compared to 11.11 million tonnes sales last year.
The company disclosed that to preserve cash flows and focus on disciplined capital allocation, it has curtailed growth capex for this year and the focus is primarily on safety environment and sustenance capital expenditure.
“During the quarter, we re-calibrated our operations and our sales across geographies in line with underlying regulatory and market conditions..Economic activity is gradually recovering. In India, we have ramped-up our capacity utilizations to 90 per cent levels with total sales in June exceeding 2019-20 average monthly sales. We are further ramping up capacity utilization and increasing domestic sales which will lead to an improvement in our margins in coming quarters’’, V Narendran, CEO & Managing Director, Tata Steel said.
Tata Steel disclosed that given the heightened economic uncertainty, it has  ramped up the liquidity buffer to Rs 20,144 crore which will be deployed to deleverage as business conditions normalize.
“Tata Steel responded very swiftly to the pandemic in April and despite the national lock down in India, the company remained focus on its cash flow management to generate a free cash flow quarter and maintained its net debt at the March 2020 level. This was achieved through cross functional co-ordination and cash war room initiatives covering fixed cost reduction, working capital management through better inventory management, focus on debtors, working with suppliers and other initiatives. This enabled the company to generate free cash flow of Rs 700 crore post capex and other obligations’’, Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and CFO, Tata Steel said.",business
MNCs in the fray to run private trains," Multinationals Alstom, Bombardier and Siemens are among the 23 probable bidders to operate private trains in the country.
A pre-bid meeting was held here on Wednesday, which was also attended by Indian companies GMR Infrastructure, Titagarh Wagons, PSUs Bharat Earth Movers Limited and BHEL along with the IRCTC. In the first meeting held on July 21, 16 firms were present.
At the second pre-bid meeting, the companies put forth several queries, including on the eligibility criteria and the bidding process. The bidders also sought clarity on the procurement of trains and their fares. They had queries on operations and maintenance and the timing of trains and halts.
The railways said it has reduced the Request for Qualification (RFQ) fee by one tenth for those entities participating in more than one project. Complete freedom will be given on the procurement of trains even as the restriction of three projects per bidder will be reduced and the leasing of trains will be permitted.
In all, the railways is inviting 12 requests for qualification to operate 151 private trains. The first dozen private trains will roll out in the next two years and all the 151 trains will run by 2026-27. The contract will be for 35 years. The project involves private investment of Rs 30,000 crore.
Analysts said the private train project is expected to boost the revenues of Indian Railways, which has been trying to look at ways to reduce losses. 
The railways recover just 57 per cent of costs through passenger fares, with the rest coming from freight subsidy. 
The railways had earlier said the operators shall have the freedom to decide on fares . 
The private entities will be selected through a two-stage competitive bidding process comprising Request for Qualification (RFQ) and Request for Proposal (RFP). The due date for opening of RFQ is September 8.",business
Coal India wants rail tariff relief," Coal India has urged Indian Railways to offer it a 15 per cent freight concession to transport domestic coal for a distance of 701-1400 kilometres (km) from its mines.  
In June, the Railway Board had decided to grant a 20 per cent concession on freight price for a distance of more than 1400 km on the transportation of coal. 
The concession is on normal tariff rates, provided that after applying the concession, the freight price should not be less than the tariff rate for a distance up to 1400 km. This concession is valid from July 2020 to June 30, 2021.
But Coal India officials on Wednesday said that there was a case for widening the scope of concession as only a handful of consumers in the power sector, which constitutes the bulk of the public sector miner’s offtake, are eligible to get the benefits.
Of the 126 coal-based thermal power plants linked to Coal India, 14 plants located beyond 1400 km are eligible for freight concession at present. 
Moreover, these plants have supply contracts of only 42 million tonnes of coal per annum. Six non-power consumers who would benefit from the present concession  have annual coal contracts of 1.37 mt per annum.
Once the concession is extended, it will boost Coal India’s offtake, which has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, and also encourage import substitution. “Extension of freight concession to customers located in the range of 701-1400 km could result in substantial domestic coal lifted by them in place of coal sourced from abroad due to lesser cost of coal conveyance,” said a senior Coal India executive.

NMDC hikes iron ore price by Rs 300," NMDC, the country’s largest iron ore miner, has hiked the rates of the mineral by Rs 300 to Rs 2,950 a tonne with immediate effect.
Iron ore is the key raw material used in steel making and, therefore, any revision in its prices has a direct impact on the prices of steel.
In a regulatory filing with the stock exchanges, NMDC said it has increased the price of lumps, or high-grade iron ore, by Rs 300 to Rs 2,950 per tonne, and that of iron ore fines, or inferior grade ore, by Rs 300 to Rs 2,660 a tonne.
The revised prices exclude royalty, District Mineral Fund (DMF), National Mineral Exploration Trust (DMET), cess, forest permit fee and other taxes, the company added. 
It disclosed that the new rates are effective from August 12.

The last revision, effective July 31, was announced on August 3, when NMDC had fixed the price of lumps at Rs 2,650 per tonne and of fines at Rs 2,360 a tonne.
NMDC is also involved in the exploration of a wide range of minerals such as copper, rock phosphate, lime stone, dolomite and gypsum.
On the BSE, its shares ended at Rs 94.35, a gain of 1.18 per cent over the last close.
In a recent note, analysts at Motilal Oswal said that the price hikes by the company have been ahead of their estimates and this has been on the back of improving volumes. ",business
Modi to launch taxpayer charter today," Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a platform to honour the country’s honest taxpayers on Thursday. The “taxpayer charter” is expected to have statutory status and will empower citizens by ensuring time-bound services by the income tax department.
The finance minister, the revenue secretary, the CBDT chief and the tax commissioners will be present at the launch.
In the budget for 2020-21, unveiled on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said “we wish to enshrine in the statutes a ‘taxpayer charter’ through this budget. Our government would like to reassure taxpayers that we remain committed to taking measures so that our citizens are free from harassment of any kind”.
She had said any tax system requires trust between taxpayers and the administration, which will be possible only when taxpayers’ rights are clearly enumerated.
The charter will list out the fundamental rights of taxpayers and the basic standards of services that they should expect. The charter will aim to change the relationship between taxpayers and the tax department from being an enforcer to a facilitator. The department, on its part, will be expected to provide services that are fair and efficient.

German lender Deutsche Bank to bring in Rs 2700cr," German lender Deutsche Bank on Wednesday announced a capital infusion of Rs 2,700 crore into its India operations for expansion across segments. 
This is the second time in less than two years that the bank has infused money into its local operations of 17 branches after bringing in Rs 3,800 crore in early 2019.
A bank statement said the fresh capital will be used to support the expansion of Deutsche Bank India across all of its businesses, including corporate banking, investment banking and international private banking, which have been consistently growing over the years. 
The bank’s chief country officer Kaushik Shaparia said the incremental capital injection should be seen as a strong validation of the lender’s confidence in the business model and potential in India. 
“It also demonstrates our intent to further deepen our presence here,” he said, adding that the recent months have thrown up opportunities to work ever more closely with clients and support them with services and advice in steering through the tough environment.

The capital adequacy ratio for the bank, which has been present in India since 1980, stood at 14.93 per cent as of March 31, 2020, which will go up after the infusion. 
Total capital deployed by Deutsche Bank in its India branches has now increased to Rs 18,200 crore and the overall assets stood at Rs 1.2 lakh crore as of March 31, 2020, the statement said.  With the Reserve Bank allowing the restructuring of loans that are facing stress because of the Covid-19 pandemic, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are likely to see an increase in their refinancing requirements, says a report. 
Last week, the RBI gave permission to lenders to go for a one-time restructuring of corporate and personal loans facing stress. 
“The RBI’s decision allowing lenders to restructure loans would increase their refinancing requirements, especially for NBFCs,” India Ratings and Research said in a report. 
“This is in view of their large contractual debt repayments, as scheduled cash inflow gets deferred, though the severity of the same would depend upon the proportion of loan portfolio restructured and terms of restructuring (i.e complete moratorium vs partial payments),” it added. ",business
BPCL selloff hurdles," Global energy players are keen to pick up the government’s 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL, given the country’s projected fuel demand over the next few years. However, they are looking at clarity over fuel pricing and other issues and waiting for the travel restrictions to be lifted, analysts said.
After the deadline for the submission of expressions of interest was extended for the third time, concerns have been raised over whether the interest of global investors was waning.
“A combination of global and domestic factors are at play in the context of BPCL’s privatisation. Several global firms have recently announced commitments to reduce fossil fuel production and thereby carbon emissions. The pandemic has also restricted movement of people. Interested bidders would like to site visits and hold in-person meetings with management teams to evaluate such a large transaction,” said Dilip Khanna, partner, strategy and transactions, EY.
K. Ravichandran, senior VP and energy analyst at Icra, said, “Once the pandemic-related restrictions are removed, there would be increased interest in the sector. One of the issues of concern for global investors would be pricing of fuel like petrol and diesel, and they could seek clarity on it.”

"Opec sees steep decline in demand, recovery in 2021 uncertain"," World oil demand will fall more steeply in 2020 than previously forecast because of the coronavirus and there are doubts about next year’s recovery, Opec forecast on Wednesday, potentially making it harder for the group and its allies to support the market.
World oil demand will tumble 9.06 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in a monthly report, more than the 8.95 million bpd decline expected a month ago.
Oil prices have collapsed as the coronavirus curtailed travel and economic activity. While some countries have eased lockdowns, allowing demand to recover, fear of new outbreaks has kept a lid on prices and Opec expects this to persist.
“Crude and product price developments in the second half of 2020 will continue to be impacted by concerns over a second wave of infections and higher global stocks,” Opec said in the report.
Opec stuck to its forecast that in 2021 oil demand would rebound by 7 million bpd but said the outlook was subject to large uncertainties that might result in “a negative impact on petroleum consumption” such as demand for air travel, more fuel-efficient cars and more competition from other fuels.

"Fuel demand slows down in July after picking up pace in May, June"," India’s fuel demand is beginning to flatten after showing signs of returning to life as consumption dipped 11.7 per cent in July, official data showed.
Fuel consumption, a barometer of economic activity in the country, had slumped over 45 per cent in April as the nationwide lockdown halted most vehicular traffic and shut industries. However, with the easing of lockdown restrictions, the demand picked up in May and June with month-on-month increase in consumption numbers. 
However, mini-lockdowns imposed by states to contain the spread of the coronavirus seemed to have stopped this recovery, with demand falling 3.5 per cent in July over the previous month. 
Fuel demand fell to 15.67 million tonnes (mt) in July, 11.7 per cent lower compared with 17.75 mt consumed in the same month a year ago, and 3.5 per cent lower than the June sales of 16.24 mt.

Churn signals Indiabulls bank hope," Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited (IHFL) has appointed former RBI deputy governor Subhash Sheoratan Mundra as its non-executive chairman — a strategic move that many believe signals that the financial services entity has not abandoned its quest for a banking licence after being stonewalled by a vicious campaign last year to undermine its credentials.
Mundra will replace Sameer Gehlaut, the founder of the Indiabulls group, who resigned as the executive chairman of IHFL with immediate effect.
In a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges after market hours, Indiabulls Housing Finance said Gehlaut has been re-designated as the non-executive, non-independent director of the company.
The company said Gehlaut resigned as he wanted to focus more on the group’s financial services firm — Indiabulls Ventures —which is into consumer lending that includes personal loans, asset reconstruction and the capital market business.
Last October, the RBI had rejected a proposal to merge Indiabulls Housing Finance with troubled Tamil Nadu-based  Lakshmi Vilas Bank, following allegations that money worth thousands of crores were siphoned off by Gehlaut and the directors. Subsequently, the petitioner who had approached the Supreme Court alleging the misappropriation of funds withdrew the plea made against Gehlaut.
At a board meeting on Wednesday, Gehlaut informed the board he has taken up the position of chief executive officer of Indiabulls Ventures Ltd. “Gehlaut proposed the name of Mundra for the position of non-executive chairman of the company. The board of directors of the company unanimously agreed with the suggestion made by Gehlaut and appointed Mundra as the non-executive chairman with immediate effect,” the company said.
Gehlaut has been leading the company for over 20 years since its inception in January 2000.
Observers who track IHFL believe there could much more to the appointment of Mundra: the company may still be preparing for a banking licence, albeit at a later date, even as it improves its corporate governance.
Analysts said the appointment of the new chief could see the company taking several steps which include improving its asset quality. After  the IL&FS crisis, players such as Indiabulls Housing Finance have faced difficulties in accessing finance at attractive rates.
Gehlaut’s resignation comes at a time both banks and non-banks are witnessing the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the form of a fall in loan disbursals and a fear of a rise in bad loans once the moratorium given by the RBI ends this month.
Amid such circumstances, analysts say, the presence of a seasoned banker such as Mundra is positive for the company.
Mundra was the RBI deputy governor till July 2017. Earlier, he was the chairman and managing director of Bank of Baroda and executive director of Union Bank of India. 
“The company has taken significant strides over the years under Gehlaut, and the board appreciated his desire to engage in another phase of institution building,” Mundra said after his appointment. 
“Indiabulls Housing has a committed management team, and it has done a good job in navigating the present challenging times. I look forward to now working even more closely with the management team, especially with the confidence that the board and the management is committed to keep striving to deliver strong business growth with high standards of governance backed by strong risk management practices,’’ Mundra said.",business
Railways shell out more in ticket refunds than ever before," Perhaps for the first time in its 167-year-long history, the Railways has refunded more than it has earned from ticket bookings, registering a negative passenger segment revenue of Rs 1,066 crore in the Covic-19-hit first quarter of 2020-21, an RTI query by a Madhya Pradesh-based activist has found.
The freight earnings, however, during the period managed to hold ground, according to the RTI reply provided to Chandra Shekhar Gaur.
The revenue in the first three months of this financial year, when the Railways had to suspend all its regular passenger services due to the coronavirus travel restrictions, was in the negative -- Rs 531.12 crore in April, Rs 145.24 crore in May and Rs 390.6 in June (all in negative), the RTI reply said.
""The minus figures are being shown due to the fact that the value of refunds is more than the value of tickets booked"", said Railway spokesperson DJ Narain.
An official explained that due to the suspension of services, tickets booked for travel in April, May and June were offered refunds, while fewer tickets were booked during these three months due to the restrictions.
The Railways has cancelled all regular passenger services indefinitely.
In the first quarter of the 2019-20 fiscal, the Railways had earned Rs 4,345 crore in April, Rs 4,463 crore in May and Rs 4,589 crore in June.
The Railways has said that due to the pandemic, it is envisaging a loss of around Rs 40,000 crore this financial year.
However, freight traffic seems to have recovered somewhat since the Railways has been the preferred mode of transportation for ferrying essential during these months.
In April 2020, the freight earning was Rs 5,744 crore, in May it was 7,289 crore and in June the number stood at Rs 8,706 crore.
In the first quarter of last fiscal year, it earned Rs 9,331 crore in April, Rs 10,032 crore in May and Rs 9,702 crore in June.
Narain said the Railways' freight operations during the last two weeks are higher than the last year's corresponding figures for the same period, adding that it is a very encouraging and positive sign.
A concerted effort by railway officials and better management practices will ensure that revenue lost in the passenger segment is significantly offset by an outstanding freight performance, Narain said.
The Railways said that it has also suffered losses to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in the running of the Shramik Special trains which began operations from May 1 to ferry stranded migrant workers home.

Aramco revives Reliance Industries interest," Saudi Aramco has indicated that it is doing a due diligence on picking up a stake in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business of Reliance Industries, which raises the prospects of some movement in the proposed $15-billion transaction.
However, at a conference call with investors after it announced its results for the half- year ended June 30, Amin H. Nasser, CEO, president and director of Aramco, did not indicate any timeline for the closure of the transaction as he refrained from giving any further details.
This is the first official comment coming from the top brass of the oil giant in several months.
“With regard to the Reliance deal, all I can say at this stage, it’s going through the due diligence. So depending on it, we will make our decision. This is a big deal. So we need to take our time to review and then decide based on the outcome of the study,’’ Nasser said when asked for an update on the progress of the  deal.
Addressing shareholders at its annual general meeting last month, RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani had said that the proposed transaction is not proceeding for now.

The deal was initially announced by the RIL chief at a shareholders meeting in 2019 where he had disclosed that Aramco would pay $15 billion for a 20 per cent stake in its O2C business.
While RIL is spinning off its O2C business into a separate subsidiary, analysts are of the view that Reliance will have to settle for a much lower valuation. It is not immediately clear if Nasser’s latest comments would lead to Reliance accepting a lesser valuation.",business
Government e-Marketplace sees potential of $100 billion of transactions," The Government e-Marketplace (GeM) platform sees a potential of $100 billion of transactions as it gears up for an upgrade in September.
The online platform, which turned four years on August 9, has registered a transaction value worth Rs 58,578 crore with 441,043 sellers and service providers on board.
GeM CEO Talleen Kumar said on Tuesday that a unified procurement system is being planned that consolidates all public procurement platforms allowing vendors to onboard on one platform. The consolidation will lead to better economies of scale, dissemination of best practices and efficient price discovery.
“The products and services amenable to procurement in a marketplace is about 5 per cent of the GDP. In India this translates roughly to Rs 5-8 lakh crore per annum. If we consider Rs 7 lakh crore per annum it translates to $100 billion. Our aim is to get as close to $100 billion per annum as possible,” Kumar said at a session organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce.
“Around 200 plus processes are in the pipeline which will be completed by September 2020,” he said.
Besides onboarding weavers and craftsmen to promote domestic industry, the platform is working with banks to provide uncollateralised working capital credit for sellers.
Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech had said that the government intends to create a unified procurement system for the public sector by providing a single platform for procurement of goods, services and works, that will benefit MSMEs.",business
Minimum support price on sugar to rise," The government is likely to hike the fair and remunerative price of sugarcane to Rs 285 per 100 kg and also the minimum support price  for sugar to Rs 33 per kg.
The cabinet is likely to arrive at a decision soon to help the mills clear the arrears of cane farmers worth Rs 20,000 crore at the earliest.
Officials said the food ministry has prepared a cabinet note to “fix the minimum selling price of white sugar and also to increase cane FRP (fair and remunerative price)”. FRP of sugarcane is now priced at Rs 275 per 100 kg, while MSP of sugar is Rs 31 per kg.
However, industry sources feel that even after the hike the price of the sweetener will remain below the cost of production of Rs 35-36 a kg. But, it would provide some relief to mills at a time most are facing liquidity issues.
Last year, the government had increased the price at which mills sell sugar to bulk buyers by Rs 2/kg to Rs 31 per kg.
The minimum selling price of sugar is fixed taking into account the components of FRP and minimum conversion cost of the most efficient mills.     
According to the official data, mills have purchased sugarcane of around Rs 72,000 crore from farmers during the 2019-20 cane season (October-September). Of that, around Rs 20,000 crore of arrears are yet to be paid to farmers.
Arrears comprise payments to be made on the basis of the FRP fixed by the Centre, and the state advisory price determined by the states.",business

The decline was cushioned by a rise in demand for entry-level cars and motorcycles in the rural and semi-urban markets.
“After a few consecutive months of falling sales in a post-Covid scenario, there are signs of green shoots in passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. Sales in August would indicate if this is sustainable demand and not just a pent-up demand,” Rajan Wadhera, president of Siam, said.

The warrant issue price together with the warrant exercise price represents a premium of 32 per cent to the closing price of its shares prior to the launch of the issue.
In addition, HDFC raised Rs 3,693 crore through the issue of redeemable non-convertible  debentures for a tenor of three years, carrying an annualised coupon rate of 5.40 per cent per annum. It added that the issue has been over-subscribed overall.
“Assuming all the warrants are exercised by investors within the next three years,  the corporation would receive an additional Rs 3,386 crore by way of securities  premium. Accordingly, the maximum equity dilution possible under  the  issue would be up to 4.26 per cent of the enhanced equity share capital of the corporation,” HDFC said.
Axis Bank too saw good response to its QIP offering from the global and domestic investor community, including several large FPIs, domestic mutual funds and insurance companies. The deal was over-subscribed with the aggregate size being Rs 10,000 crore.
The issue was done at a price of Rs 420.10 per share ,a discount of five per cent to the floor price of Rs 442.19 per share.
“We believe that the Bank is well placed to leverage all the possible growth opportunities that will come in as the economy opens up and is in a strong position to combat the challenges that emanate from the Covid-19 pandemic crisis. We believe in the strong fundamentals of the Indian economy and based on our vision for growth, profitability and sustainability, will keep delivering the best value to our customers, shareholders and investors’’, Amitabh Chaudhry, MD & CEO, Axis Bank said.",business
Food retail prices up in July," India’s retail inflation edged up slightly in July due to higher food prices, remaining firmly above the RBI’s medium-term target of 4 per cent for a 10th straight month, a Reuters poll showed.
Food prices, which account for nearly half the inflation basket, have soared since April because of supply-side disruptions caused by a nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
While the central government gradually eased restrictions in June, regional lockdowns in some major agricultural producing states continued to disrupt supplies of essential perishables like fruits and vegetables.
The August 6-10 Reuters poll of over 45 economists showed Indian retail inflation rose to 6.15 per cent last month from 6.09 per cent in June.
Forecasts for the data, scheduled to be released on August 12, ranged from 5.00 per cent to 6.55 per cent.
“We see July CPI inflation to be steady above the Reserve Bank of India’s policy limit. Food remained a dominant inflation driver but high utility and transport costs also contributed,” said Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING. Reuters
The government suspended the release of CPI inflation headline numbers for April and May due to insufficient data during the lockdown.
The RBI kept interest rates on hold last week after reducing the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February - despite a recent rise in retail consumer prices - but said it would ensure inflation remains within target.
According to the RBI’s latest survey, household inflation expectations for the three-month and one-year horizons rose to over 10% in July, suggesting Asia’s third-largest economy could enter a period of stagflation - a phase with lofty inflation, high unemployment and stagnant demand.
“With inflation expected to remain elevated on supply side disruptions, we think a rate cut is more probable in December,” said Rini Sen, India economist at ANZ.
“We expect food prices to abate likely from September onwards, once the rabi crop (summer harvest) enters the market.”
Monsoon rains, which are critical for farm output and economic growth, are expected to be 104% of a long-term average in August and September, indicating bumper harvests and helping to alleviate the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.",business
Fitch: Worry over debt recast," The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision on the one-time restructuring of stressed advances may delay bad loan recognition, Fitch Ratings said on Monday.
Last week, the RBI had allowed banks to restructure loans facing stress because of the Covid-19 crisis.
Fitch said there would now be more uncertainty over the asset quality of banks.
The recast opens a window for banks to build capital buffers while putting off the full recognition of the pandemic’s impact on loan portfolios. The mechanism is reminiscent of a strategy adopted over 2010-2016 that delayed and exacerbated problems for the banks, the ratings agency said.
Fitch pointed out that the scheme may be designed to give banks more time to raise capital to address the impact of the crisis on loan portfolios.
The ratings agency said PSU banks may find it difficult to raise funds as investors may be reluctant to participate in the sales of stakes in state-owned lenders until the impact of the pandemic on their balance sheets is clear.
It also felt that delaying the recognition of problems in the banking sector could provide some short-term support to economic growth by stimulating credit issuance.
“However, many state banks may remain reluctant to lend to all but the most creditworthy borrowers in the near term, as their overall weak capital position remains unsupportive of growth — even with impaired loans permitted to be classified as ‘standard’ after rescheduling,” the rating agency noted.
Besides, the attempts to restructure debts between 2010 and 2016 were characterised by poor implementation and weak monitoring. The central bank has, however, looked to address this concern by tightening supervision through the Kamath  Committee, which will vet all restructuring plans involving creditors with more than Rs 1,500 crore of debt.",business
Industrial production falls 16.6 per cent in June," Industrial production fell 16.6 per cent in June, the fourth straight month of contraction — but pent-up demand burst through during the month as a result of which the pace of contraction was a lot slower than in the previous three months.
According to the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) data, manufacturing sector production registered a decline of 17.1 per cent, while the output of mining fell 19.8 per cent and power, 10 per cent.
Industrial production contracted 34.7 per cent in May after falling 57.6 per cent on a yearly basis in April. IIP had expanded 1.3 per cent year-on-year in June 2019.
The contraction will be still less in July, according to Aditi Nayar, principal economist of Icra, based on various lead indicators such as the output of Coal India Limited, electricity consumption and GST e-way bills that contracted in narrow single-digits in July.
“Nevertheless, we continue to caution that pent-up demand contributed to the improved performance of certain categories of manufacturing in June-July 2020, which may not sustain in August 2020 especially in the light of the extension of localised lockdowns in various states,” she said.

Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Care Ratings, said some industries restocked goods which were depleted in April and May when production was hindered by the lockdown. He said there appeared to be a positive relation between the unlock process and the IIP growth numbers.
“While it has been negative in the three months, there has been improvement in May over April and improvement in June over May.”
“While there still exists localised lockdowns in several geographies production will be impacted in July and August for sure and we may expect negative growth in these months,” Sabnavis said.
He said the strong decline in the first quarter will weigh heavily on GDP growth estimate for the quarter which can tend towards -20 per cent.",business
Lockdown: Surge in demand for cheaper homes," Pent up demand created during the lockdown period has induced a spike in booking for apartments in the last two months, bringing relief to the hapless developers who expect the momentum to continue only if there is a corresponding uplift in the overall economy.
City-based developers and brokers say enquiries have gone up and the number of bookings have increased in June and July compared with the previous two months, but they are still far away from the pre-Covid levels.
“Enquiries which had completely stopped have started coming back a bit. Properties priced below Rs 1 crore has traction and ready-to-move (RTM) apartments have an edge over unfinished ones. I believe well known brands will do better in the current scenario,” Harsh V. Neotia, chairman of Ambuja Neotia, said.
Sanjay Jain, managing director of Siddha, agreed. “Seeing demand for RTM properties in one of our projects in north Calcutta, we are readying 100 more units to bring to the market,” said Jain, who claimed sales are back to 60-70 per cent of normal times.
NK Realtor, one of the top city-based brokers, says three out of four properties booked in the last four months are under the Rs 50 lakh bracket. Biplab Kumar, vice-president of NK, said there has been a month-on-month improvement in booking with the best seen in July.

There is a changing bias towards large complexes post Amphan and during the pandemic. Around 47 per cent of the 500-odd respondents to a survey conducted by the brokerage say they prefer to stay in projects having 500-plus apartments.
Visible advantages of staying within a gated community during a crisis is drawing buyers in Calcutta and beyond. Arya Sumant, managing director of Eden Realty Ventures, witnessed more bookings in June-July than November-December in his ultra-affordable project (Rs 9 lakh-Rs 23 lakh) in Serampore.
“I was really surprised. Believe that the fence sitters came forward. It was more of a pent up demand created during lockdown,” Sumant said.
But he had a word of caution too. “How the rest of the year is going to pan out will depend on the economy. If there is no job security, how many people would come forward to buy property? After all, one takes a long term view of income while taking a home loan,” Sumant said.
Jitendra Khaitan, chairman and managing director of Pioneer Properties, noted that only serious buyers are in the market.
However, that would not necessarily mean that all bookings would translate into agreement for sale. “There is at least 10-15 per cent cancellation from booking usually. Given that many developers offered easy exit terms, the number may rise,” an industry source pointed out.
Sidharth Pansari, managing director of Primarc, however, sees little challenge in existing projects. “If you have built a reputation for delivering quality projects on time, there should not be any problem,” Pansari said, adding focus on right size and pricing has paid off during this time.
Few launches, loans scarce Knight Frank, an international property consultancy, noted that there have been no launches in the Calcutta market during April-June. Neotia said he didn’t expect launches before November.
Top developers sell around 11,000-12,000 units a year on an average. The Knight Frank report suggests 2,937 units were sold during January-June, all of which took place before lockdown.
The report says more than 30,000 units continue to remain unsold as on June 30.
The bias towards RTM properties also means that there is an incentive for builders to complete existing projects rather than taking up new ones which typically takes 36-48 months to complete. Bank finances have also become scarce and costlier, said Surekha Bihani, managing director (East) of JLL India.
Even though many projects have been registered with state regulator from April onwards, builders are wary of bringing them to the market, fearing lack of demand. This, however, does not mean that there is any dearth of choice.",business
JSW Steel July output falls 5%," JSW Steel on Tuesday said its crude steel production during July stood at 12.46 lakh tonnes (lt), down 5 per cent from the same period a year ago.
The company had produced 13.17lt crude steel in July 2019, it said in a statement.
However, on a month-on-month basis there has been an improvement both in terms of steel production and average capacity utilisation.
“On a month-on-month basis, the crude steel production achieved for the month of July 2020 was at 12.46lt, showing a growth of 9 per cent over June 2020. The average capacity utilisation during the month of July was 83 per cent against 76 per cent in June 2020,” it said.
During July, output of flat rolled products was at 9.40lt, up 3.5 per cent from 9.08lt in the same month of 2019.
The company’s production of long rolled products fell 24 per cent to 2.40lt in the period under review, from 3.16lt in July 2019.

Equity mutual funds see outflow for first time in 4 years," Equity mutual funds saw their first outflow in four years in July as profit booking by investors saw them making net withdrawals of Rs 2,480.35 crore. In the preceding month, the net inflows into these schemes stood at Rs 240.55 crore. 
The schemes have been showing a declining trend since April, attracting Rs 11,723 crore in March, Rs 6,213 crore in April and Rs 5,257 crore in May.
Data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) on Monday showed that the outflows were maximum in the case of multi-cap funds at Rs 1,033 crore (net outflows of Rs 778 crore in June). It was followed by mid-cap, contra and focussed funds. Barring equity-linked saving schemes that saw an inflow of Rs 279 crore) and focused fund (Rs 535 crore) categories, all the other equity segments witnessed a net outflow.
Experts said that the net outflow was because of profit booking by investors amid concerns about expensive valuations in the market despite the rising number of coronavirus cases in India and an economy under contraction. 
Overall, the mutual fund industry witnessed a net inflow of Rs 89,813 crore across all segments last month, much higher than Rs 7,265 crore seen in June. This inflow has been attributed to the infusion in liquid and low-duration funds. The assets under management (AUM) of the industry as a whole increased 5 per cent to Rs 27.3 lakh crore.
Amfi chief executive N. S. Venkatesh attributed the outflow to withdrawal from multi-cap and large cap funds because of profit-booking by investors.
He added that investor confidence in the market continues to be robust, going by rising net fresh SIP registrations and overall increase in the average asset under management of mutual funds since the pandemic. Debt mutual fund schemes, he noted, are an attractive proposition, with a benign interest rate environment leading to better yields as also superior risk management by the debt fund managers.
“The outlook for the mutual fund flows for the rest of 2020-21 would continue to be encouraging with rising digital-driven inflows, accommodative stance on interest rates by the RBI, improving macro-economic environment and a pick-up in economic activity on the back of easing of lockdown,’’ Venkatesh observed.

Unions call off coal strike after delay in commercial mining auction," Coal industry unions have deferred a one-day strike scheduled on August 18. The strike was called against the government decision to open up the sector for commercial coal mining by private players.
Five central trade unions — BMS, HMS, AITUC, CITU and INTUC — last month declared their decision to go on a one-day strike against issues such as commercial coal mining, disinvestment of Coal India and the wages of contract workers. 
However, a deferment of the auction process has now prompted the unions to call off the strike for the time being. 
The auction of blocks earmarked for commercial mining will now take place between October 19, 2020 and November 9, 2020. 
Difficulties in site visits by prospective bidders because of the lockdown and the need to review the initial list of 41 coal blocks after objections were raised over ecological concerns have led to a delay.
“The auction dates have been deferred by the government. So, the strike has also been deferred,” said D.D. Ramandan of the CITU-affiliated All India Coal Workers Federation. 
“A date has not been fixed yet. The unions will meet in October and take a further call on the strike,” said Nathulal Pandey of HMS. 
Informally, it has been discussed among the unions that a protest could happen between November 5 and November 9 ahead of the nominated authority of the Centre recommending the successful bidders on November 11, 2020. ",business
Lockdown: passenger vehicle sales skid 25%," Passenger vehicle sales in July declined 25.19 per cent to 1,57,373 units over the corresponding period last year as the impact of the pandemic on vehicle offtakes continues, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (Fada) said on Monday.
Pitching for industry-specific policies to boost demand for the speedy revival of the auto sector, Fada president Ashish Harsharaj Kale said as the country continues to open up, July saw better registrations compared with June, though on a year-on-year basis recovery in the auto sector is yet to be anywhere near normal.
Two-wheeler sales declined 37.47 per cent to 8,74,638 units last month from 13,98,702 units in July 2019. Commercial vehicle sales declined 72.18 per cent to 19,293 units compared with 69,338 units in July 2019.
Total sales across categories declined 36.27 per cent to 11,42,633 units last month against 17,92,879 units in the year-ago month.
Current market conditions are still not indicative of the actual demand situation on an all-India level and retail sales continue to decline in huge double digits despite the low base of last year. 
The rural market, however, continues to show strong sales growth for tractors, small commercial vehicles and motorcycles as monsoon continues its good spell, Kale said.
Banks and NBFCs though flush with high liquidity are still cautious about funding, affecting demand revival, especially in the commercial vehicle, three-wheeler and two wheeler segments, he added.
Maruti Suzuki India continued to lead domestic passenger vehicle retails in July, followed by Hyundai, Tata Motors and M&M. ",business
"ICICI kicks off QIP issue to mobilise Rs 15,000 cr"," ICICI Bank has set a floor price of Rs 351.36 per share for its qualified institutional placement (QIP) to mobilise Rs 15,000 crore, while InterGlobe Aviation, the parent of budget carrier IndiGo, announced its plans to mobilise Rs 4,000 crore.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Mortgage lender HDFC had last week announced plans to raise  Rs 14,000-crore through the issue of equity shares and warrants and up to Rs 9,000 crore via secured redeemable non-convertible debentures. 
HDFC’s  QIP comprised Rs 10,000 crore through equity shares and Rs 4,000 crore from warrants. 
Axis Bank had also witnessed a strong response to its QIP which sought to raise Rs 10,000 crore. 
Earlier, Kotak Mahindra Bank had mobilised Rs 7,000 crore through this route.
The lenders are raising funds as they prepare for a possible rise in bad loans during the second half of this fiscal. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also asked them to shore up their capital base.
ICICI Bank had decided to set aside Rs 5,500 crore as provisions for possible reverses on the loan book in the June quarter, where its consolidated net profit grew 24 per cent to Rs 3,118 crore on the back of one-time gains on stake sales in insurance arms. Analysts are  divided on how the bad loan situation unfolds as some feel that non-performing assets (NPAs) will not see a huge rise after the central bank announced a one-time restructuring mechanism last week. Banks will, however, have to make a provision of at least 10 per cent on cases where such a restructuring has been done.
“We believe that the restructuring will certainly slow down/defer the NPA formation well below the RBI’s expectation, while 10 per cent provisioning cost for banks should discourage unwarranted restructuring,’’ analysts at Emkay said in a recent note.
The financial stability report of the RBI, released last month, had projected that baseline gross bad loans for the system would rise to 12.5 per cent of bad assets and in the worst case to 14.5 per cent during this fiscal from 8.5 per cent as of March 31, 2020. 
The projection did not factor in a restructuring mechanism. InterGlobe Aviation’s board has approved a plan to raise up to Rs 4,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement of shares, subject to the approval of the company’s shareholders and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.
Ahead of the announcement, its shares settled 1.43 per cent higher at Rs 952.90 on the BSE.",business

Gadkari asks to reduce China import dependency," The government plans to encourage the manufacturing of select products to boost import substitution.
Addressing a virtual MSME conclave organised by the Ficci Karnataka State Council, Union MSME minister Nitin Gadkari said there is a need to think on how India can increase exports and reduce import dependence. 
Speaking about Chinese exports, Gadkari said 30 per cent of the entire global manufacturing is based in China and there are 10 major export categories that comprise 70 per cent of its overall exports, including fields such as electrical machinery and equipment.     
“Now, this is the time... we should identify which are the fields where we can make import substitution, how we can develop the MSMEs and the industry by which we can take advantage of the economic situation in the world,” said Gadkari, who is also the road transport and highways minister.

Supreme Court raps bankrupt telecom operators for filing insolvency," The Supreme Court on Monday asked telecom operators Reliance Communications (R-Com) and Aircel and others why they went in for insolvency proceedings when they had more than Rs 40,000-crore dues in adjusted gross revenues hanging over them.
The court asked the department of telecommunications (DoT)  why it did not move the apex court against the insolvency cases at the National Company Law Tribunal where national resources such as spectrum were listed as assets, meaning they could be sold to pay off dues. 
Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the DoT,  told the bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Abdul Nazeer and M.R. Shah: “We have told the NCLT that spectrum can’t be owned by anyone… We have raised the point that a company which is to go into insolvency cannot show the spectrum as one of the assets. Spectrum cannot be owned by anyone like this. Government is the trustee. Spectrum is a national asset.”
The bench, which is hearing  the case relating to the payment of Rs 1.47 lakh crore dues in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) from the private operators to the exchequer, adjourned the matter till Friday, by which time the operators and the DoT will have to come up with their position on the insolvency claims.
The solicitor-general told the court that Aircel had shown spectrum as its assets in the insolvency proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal(NCLT).

“What’s the material placed on record for the insolvency? What were the reasons to initiate insolvency,” Justice Mishra asked.
The solicitor-general said it was for the respective companies to address the court on the issue. “We have told the NCLT that spectrum cannot be an asset of a company. Cannot be sold.” 
He said the objections raised by the Centre against the sale of R-Com’s spectrum were also under the consideration of the tribunal.
“We want to know the cause of initiation of insolvency for telecom companies under IBC. We want to know if there is any urgency,” the bench asked.
The court asked the solicitor general why the DoT did not bother to file an appeal before it against the NCLT proceedings that spectrum cannot be part of bankruptcy assets. “What if spectrum is sold in the meanwhile?” Justice M.R. Shah asked.
Senior advocate Shyam Divan appearing for RCom said the insolvency proceedings had to be undergone by the company as the “monetisation outside the IBC failed due to lack of consensus among lenders”.
The court wondered how come the NCLAT revived insolvency proceedings despite RCom’s payment to Ericsson. The court then asked the resolution professional in the RCom-IBC matter to file his stance on the issue.
“If your main asset is spectrum, then you don't want to pay anything,” the court observed to the RCom’s 
resolution professional while seeking the DoT’s response also on the issue.
According to RCom, the resolution plan is presently pending NCLT approval after being cleared by the committee of creditors (CoC).
On July 2 the apex court had agreed to consider a staggered payment of over Rs 1.47 lakh crore AGR dues, but sought details on the bona fide of the insolvency claims made by R-Com, Aircel, Videocon and Sistema Shyam Teleservices. ",business
Stick to the target," In the highly commoditised realm of investments, the “right product for the right investor” is a custom that is more honoured in the breach than in the observance. Acquisition of the wrong kind of saving and investment products— clearly, a result of mis-buying — is fairly common. Indeed, this has been a matter of grave concern through the ages and is likely to remain so unless the investment fraternity becomes sufficiently aware of its consequences.
In a panic-stricken world ruled by the relentless march of a deadly virus, product suitability has morphed into a true hot button. Its significance is acutely felt in the myriad instances of needless buys we see all around us. An elderly investor buys a risky sector fund, a fresh college graduate holds an endowment insurance policy he will not need anytime soon, while a young professional loses money in agri-commodities he does not understand.
Even as you read this article, large quantities of resources are locked into sub-optimal investment products that are actually quite redundant. And while portfolio performance suffers, dense layers of intermediation keep forming. A thousand commissions, brokerages, loads and sundry other charges for such intermediation eat into the average investor’s returns. At the same time, a farrago of myths and untruths accumulates in the market.
While many stories on the subject have been written in the past, this may just be the time to revisit it. That is because of Covid-19 and its consequences, which have together wrecked many personal investment plans. This is also the time to look at your own portfolio and ascertain whether you hold unsuitable investment products that discourage efficient performance. You are the final arbiter, remember. In other words, when your personal banker brings up the subject of an NFO (new fund offer), or when your wealth manager discusses a PMS (portfolio management scheme), or when your insurance adviser refers to a pension plan, find out whether you will really gain from it.
Does the product truly fill a gap in my portfolio? You need to find the answer to this question, and it needs to be a convincing one. 
In this context, the following are important considerations:
The product should not be a mere adornment. Instead, it should actually introduce a smart, bright element to the existing array of investments
It should not be a mere me-too product. If it leads to duplication, it has to be avoided, or, in the very least, delayed
There should be no unnecessary additions to expenses and taxes — at the end of the day, these rank among an investor’s bitterest enemies If you are not convinced with the sales spiel, you need to “ditch the pitch” — deliver a firm “No” in turn. Yes, the absence of an affirmative action will rob the insurance executive or the mutual fund distributor of his earnings, but that is not your primary concern. You have to realise that you alone are responsible for your portfolio. Don’t make the latter someone else’s happy hunting grounds — not at the cost of efficient performance.
While most ordinary sales propositions are fairly cut-and-dry, some are apparently cobbled together with what can be loosely termed as “freebies”. That moniker typically derives strength from the FMCG industry. Purchase a large bottle of a popular health drink and you will get a small stainless steel cup with it. The latter, as the accompanying product label advertises, works as a gift for the buyer. For the ordinary consumer, it portrays a generous offer; in reality, it is an enticement.
FMCG-style freebies mostly come at a cost that is borne by customers themselves. The critical poser here is simple: who pays? The question assumes primacy in the investment space too when, for instance, a mutual fund comes up with an insurance add-on.
Such a deal may at first require you to set up an SIP in an equity fund for the long term. It may encompass an insurance value-addition, subject to terms and conditions. Well, we will deliver a caveat here — there must be someone who has to pay the premium for such bundled insurance. As the buyer, you need to find out whether it is you who is merrily paying for it. The well-known story of the curious case of the dog that did not bark in the night has a lesson for investors too. When a pitch for an investment product is made, there will certainly be questions in your mind; you have to ask them before cheques are signed. Only a cautious canine will identify a random burglar before a theft is perpetrated.
In recent years, investors who have asked the right questions have been able to avoid irrelevant purchases. Few choices demonstrate this better than mutual funds. There are plenty of me-too funds in the market. If your portfolio has, for example, three large-cap funds, do you really need a fourth one?
My point is simple; an additional purchase is justified only if it makes sense. Remember, there is a glaring commonality of objectives — fund managers often tend to chase the same securities in a confined universe. So professionally run portfolios too end up with serious overlaps. The scenario holds true for debt securities as well.
The answer does not really lie in product differentiation, contrary to what some investment circles preach.
At the end of the day, it makes sense to buy hand-picked and straight-laced products representing various categories of asset classes. An intelligent investor will try to avoid me-too items disguised as nuanced versions from within the same asset class.

"Recovery signs in housing, fastest in Bangalore"," Enquiries on residential housing that had sagged during the early period of the lockdown have now improved and reached 50 per cent of the pre Covid-19 levels.
According to a report from Anarock Consultants, the recovery has been the fastest in Bangalore, where current enquiries have reached 70 per cent of the January-February period, followed by Gurgaon at nearly 65 per cent. 
Employees from IT/ITeS, pharma, manufacturing industries and the government sector are driving the demand.
The real estate consultancy firm said that in terms of the preferred budget range, homes priced between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 1.25 crore are attracting a major chunk of the enquiries. Bangalore, Chennai, Ghaziabad and Noida are seeing maximum demand for homes below Rs 1 crore.
Anarock said buyers in Calcutta, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Hyderabad and Noida are more inclined towards 3BHKs and upwards, while the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has seen a higher preference for 2BHKs over the previous 1BHK.
“Though site visits are far from the previous levels, the site-visit-to-closure conversion rate has increased considerably as only serious buyers are venturing out, with casual window shoppers fairly dormant currently,” Prashant Thakur, director & head-research, Anarock Property Consultants said.
Hyderabad is seeing an average of 15 per cent site visits converting to sales against 8 per cent in the pre-Covid period. Gurgaon, with just 4-5 per cent conversions earlier, is clocking 8-10 per cent. Other cities report similar trends, Anarock said. 
MMR is witnessing enquiries for homes priced within Rs 60 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore, for property sizes between 400 square feet and 800 square feet carpet area.
Addressing shareholders recently at its annual general meeting, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had disclosed unsold housing units were already higher prior to the lockdown in the major cities.

Car makers optimistic of SUV sales," Car makers are going ahead with their SUV plans despite a surge in interest in small cars. 
Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) rolled out its BS-VI S-Cross, while Kia unveiled the Sonet and Toyota its Urban Cruiser as the car makers are optimistic that SUVs will continue to have a good spell. The launches come at a time hatchbacks Alto and Wagon R topped the July sales charts. 
Commenting on the renewed interest in hatchbacks post lockdown, MSIL chairman R. C. Bhargava said, “The market, at present, seems to favour smaller hatchbacks and petrol and CNG cars. Fortunately, we are well placed for such products.”
Maruti’s “refined SUV” S-Cross will have the 1.5-litre K series BS-VI petrol engine and will retail at a price range of Rs 8.39 lakh to Rs 12.39 lakh. 
South Korean manufacturer Kia will start retail sales of the Sonet during the festive season in India. 
The Anantapur plant in Andhra Pradesh set up by Kia Motors India will be the company’s global export base for markets in West Asia, Africa, Latin America and Asia, according to Ho Sung Song, president and CEO, Kia Motors Corporation,-.
“We have set up a manufacturing facility in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, with an investment of $2 billion.
Our ambitions in India are not just to satisfy the local market. Our plant will be the global export base to 70 countries. In India, we started our journey with the online booking of our mid-SUV Seltos exactly a year ago. We had a six per cent market share in the first half of this year,” said Song.
Toyota is all set to launch the Urban Cruiser, its youngest SUV, which is a crossbadge of Maruti’s Vitara Brezza. The company showcased the car and will launch it in the festive season.",business
RIL poised to take big leap in petrochemicals," Analysts are betting big on Reliance Industries’ core oil-to-chemical (O2C) business even as its consumer facing business may be making all the headlines.
The O2C business was the worst hit in the first quarter of the current financial year as a slump in the global economy hit crude oil prices and its revenues from the refining segment fell more than half to Rs 46,642 crore. The turnover from the petrochemical business fell 33 per cent to Rs 25,192 crore.
Analysts at BofA Securities said in a note that RIL’s O2C business is well placed to generate sustained free cash flow because of inherent advantages and a massive expansion.
“Until demand normalises, RIL is looking to maximise throughput, focus on cost by leveraging deep petrochemical integration and continue to focus on domestic fuel marketing,” it said
In November last year, RIL confirmed plans to invest Rs 70,000 crore to establish a crude oil-to-chemicals (COTC) complex at the company’s Jamnagar facility. 
The plan is also to convert the Jamnagar site’s existing fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit to a high severity FCC or petro FCC unit, to maximise ethylene and propylene yields
“RIL’s strategy is to transform the Jamnagar refinery from a producer of transportation fuels to chemicals. The company wants to achieve a rate of more than 70 per cent in the conversion of crude to olefins and aromatics,” it said.
Moreover, the company also commissioned a refinery off-gas cracker in January 2019 at the same site with 1.5-million-tonnes ethylene capacity. 
The brokerage feels when commodity prices recover, the returns in this segment should improve.
The brokerage added that a key focus for RIL is renewable energy, and for that it intends to build an optimal mix of clean and affordable energy with hydrogen, wind, solar, fuel cells and battery.",business
Centre's push to promote local production of solar energy faces hurdles," The Centre’s plans to impose a basic customs duty on the import of solar cells and modules to promote domestic manufacturing could turn out to be counter productive for local manufacturers as more than 50 per cent of the installed capacity is located in special economic zones (SEZs).
According to manufacturers, a customs duty in the range of 10-20 per cent is being considered with the country importing 90 per cent of the solar equipment, mostly from China. This will be in addition to the safeguard duty of around 15 per cent on the import of cells and modules that has been extended till July 2021.
“BCD is a good barrier for blocking unfair trade practices where goods are just dumped into the country. But, unfortunately in the solar sector, manufactures in SEZ are close to 50 per cent of the total capacity. If we do not treat the units in SEZs equivalent to domestic tariff areas, it will be counter-productive to Atmanirbhar Bharat,” said Saibaba Vutukuri, CEO of Vikram Solar.
“If BCD comes, it will be in addition to the safeguard duty. A manufacturer would be liable to pay BCD on value addition whenever modules are cleared from SEZs to the DTA (domestic tariff area), irrespective of the fact that the cells or modules are being made in SEZs,” said Avinash Hiranandani, global CEO and MD, RenewSys.
Manufacturers with units located in SEZs are instead in favour of an equalisation levy in the range of 0.9-1.5 per cent in lieu of BCD, adjusting for the taxation benefits enjoyed by SEZs compared with the units located outside.

The industry is apprehensive that the units located in SEZs have availed tax benefits in the past and BCD imposed would put manufacturing units located outside at a cost disadvantage.
“Equalisation levy will set off the benefits availed by the units in SEZs and ensure that units in both SEZs and DTAs are placed on a similar footing,” Vutukuri said.",business
Khaitan holding in freefall after IndusInd Bank invokes pledged shares," The Khaitan family’s ownership grip over the top group companies withered further after lender IndusInd Bank invoked its pledged shares in Eveready Industries India Ltd and McLeod Russel India Ltd.
The promoter holding of the family now stands below 10 per cent in dry cell battery maker Eveready, while it slipped below 20 per cent in bulk tea producer McLeod.
IndusInd Bank cornered a 7.82 per cent stake in Eveready and a 7.5 per cent stake in McLeod, respectively, on account of the loan taken by their parent company Williamson Magor & Co Ltd. 
Following the invocation, Khaitans’ stake will come down to a meagre 7.25 per cent in Eveready, further widening the gap with the Burman family, the promoters of Dabur, who now holds 19.84 per cent in the company.
In McLeod Russel, the Khaitan family will be left with an 18.32 per cent share. However, they continue to remain in the management in both the  entities — Aditya Khaitan is at the helm of McLeod and his nephew Amritanshu Khaitan is in charge of Eveready.

The Khaitans held 44.11 per cent in Eveready and 42.71 per cent in McLeod as on March 31, 2019 before relentless invocation of pledged shares brought down their holding. 
Unlike many other shareholders, who invoked their pledged shares and offloaded them in the market — IL&FS sold 7.09 per cent in the market allowing the Burmans to scoop up a large chunk — IndusInd decided to carry the shares on its books, indicating it is possibly expecting further appreciation in the stock prices .
Regulatory filings by Williamson Magor & Co suggest that it had extended a corporate guarantee worth Rs 200 crore to IndusInd Bank on behalf of troubled group firm McNally Bharat Engineering Co Ltd during financial year 2015-16. 
From the next fiscal, the corporate guarantee appeared to have routed through Seajuli Developers & Finance Ltd, an unlisted firm of the group. 
The amount of corporate guarantee, however, has come down since and it stood at Rs 104.25 crore as on March 31, 2019, according to the latest data available.
On Saturday, IndusInd informed the stock exchanges that the equity shares of Eveready and McLeod Russel held by Williamson Magor and Co were pledged with the bank for securing the outstanding dues of Seajuli Developers & Finance Limited (Seajuli), the borrower company. 
“The bank has invoked the pledge held on the aforesaid shares for the recovery of its dues from Seajuli,” it noted.
Going by the closing prices on Friday, IndusInd Bank’s combined holding in the two entities would stand a shade above Rs 93 crore. The control of the family is apparently slipping away at a time the Williamson Magor Group — founded by late Brij Mohan Khaitan — is seeing some good tidings in the business, which in turn is having a galvanising effect on their stock performances.
The Eveready stock has risen 80.45 per cent from July 13, a day before the Burman family announced increasing their holding by 8.48 per cent. Since then, the company also received a credit rating upgrade from India Ratings & Research, the first in three years.
Ind-Ra had cited improved liquidity position aided by deleveraging, sustained profitability, an expectation of further improvement in business profile and its liquidity position this fiscal, a possible resolution of the contingent liability issue and the possibility of a managerial/board representation by the Burman family.
McLeod, too, is inching towards a resolution of its debt problem as two of the top lenders agreed to a comprehensive recast, buoyed by soaring prices of tea this season. The possibility of a resolution and a spike in tea prices propelled the stock to Rs 13.30 on Friday, multiplying from the low of Rs 1.84 seen on March 25, 2000.
“The soaring stock prices appear to be providing the shareholders an opportunity to invoke their pledged shares and make good of the outstanding loan,” a market participant noted.",business
BPCL selloff doubt this fiscal," The strategic sale of the  government’s 53 per cent stake in state-owned refiner BPCL is unlikely this fiscal, which can impact the Modi-government’s disinvestment targets. 
Senior government officials were not hopeful of the deal going through in the current fiscal. They said one has to see how the situation develops after September, the new deadline to submit the expressions of interest (EoI).
The officials pointed out it takes around 9 months to 12 months for a selloff exercise. If bidders submit EoIs by September, they will get access to the data room to study the financials of the BPCL. Given the restrictions on international travel, it would be naive to expect the global bidders to travel immediately, the officials said. 
The government has for the third time extended the deadline for the submission of EOIs for BPCL to the end of September, which has put a question mark on the Centre’s ability to achieve the ambitious disinvestment target of Rs 2.10 lakh crore set for the current fiscal.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget had stated that the government plans to garner Rs 1,20,000 crore from the selloff in PSUs and another Rs 90,000 crore from the sale of the government’s stake in banks and financial institutions.

The ambitious divestment target depends heavily on the proceeds from the strategic divestment of public sector companies such as BPCL, Container Corp and Shipping Corp, along with the listing of insurance behemoth LIC.
Analysts said the lower than expected disinvestment collection would have an impact on the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit has zoomed to 83.2 per cent, or Rs 6.62 lakh crore, of the full year’s budget estimates by the end of June, hit by poor tax revenues and rising expenditures because of the lockdown.
Analysts estimated the stake sale would garner Rs 70,000-80,000 crore to the government. However, with the global oil giants reportedly showing interest, the stake sale could fetch Rs 1.2 lakh crore. 
Sources have said Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (Adnoc), Rosneft of Russia, Exxon Mobil and Reliance are likely to participate in the bidding.
According to the offer for sale, the government is proposing the strategic disinvestment of its entire shareholding in BPCL comprising 114.91 crore equity shares, which constitute 52.98 per cent of equity, along with the transfer of management control to a strategic buyer. The sale excludes  BPCL’s shareholding of 61.65 per cent in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd.
The bidding will be a two-stage affair, with qualified bidders in the first EoI phase being asked to make a financial bid in the second round.",business

SpiceJet flies to Toronto from New Delhi," Budget carrier SpiceJet has made its maiden long-haul charter flight to Toronto, Canada, from New Delhi, carrying 352 stranded nationals and permanent residents of that country.
The airline used a wide-bodied A330 Neo aircraft procured from Hi Fly, a Portuguese charter airline, on wet lease. The carrier is the first Indian budget airline to operate a long-haul flight to North America.
Chairman and MD Ajay Singh said the airline has operated flights across the globe repatriating close to 85,000 people and transporting over 28,000 tons of medical and essential supplies in these troubled times. Being the first Indian budget airline to operate a non-stop long-haul flight to North America is a proud moment for the SpiceJet family.”
The budget carrier has got a slot at London’s Heathrow Airport to operate daily flights from India to London from September 1. However, details have not been made available so far. It has also been allowed to fly on India-US routes by the Centre under the bilateral air bubble. The flight schedules on this route have not yet been worked out, so far.
All international commercial air passenger services in India are suspended since March 22, in the wake of travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, various evacuation and charter flights are being currently operated to fly back stranded Indians in various countries and also transport foreign nationals, who are stuck in India, to their countries.

Duty shield for MSMEs," Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday  said the government would consider increasing duties on sectors that are heavily dependent on imports to encourage domestic industry, especially MSMEs.
“India needs to manufacture more (to increase volume) and this will result in lower prices. An increase in import duty will encourage Indian manufacturers. When the production is in bulk, the cost will be competitive,” Gadkari said at a virtual summit organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).
The minister did not specify the type of products.
Gadkari said industries must identify the imported products and the obstacles in their domestic production to improve the ease of doing business.
He asked the CII to identify the issues faced by MSMEs in the country. “The CII should identify where our MSMEs and small scale industries can create a market in India and what are the sectors where we can increase exports,” the minister said.

In the last few months, the government hiked the import duty on items such as bamboo, used in making agarbatti, to 25 per cent from 10 per cent to encourage the use of local bamboo. The minister said the move will give jobs to 25-30 lakh people.
Gadkari urged industry to identify the sectors heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China. Asserting that a case study is in the offing based on three years of imports and exports, Gadkari said China’s 70 per cent exports pertained to 10 sectors.
“MSMEs need to get a market here in India. Dependence on imports (from China) has to be reduced… We also need to upgrade technology, make our ports, rail and roads more efficient,” he said.",business
Bengal eyes $20 billion investment for logistics," Bengal could attract investment worth $20 billion in the logistics sector by using the state’s unique locational advantage and harnessing its vast network of rail, road and river.
The state government has sought feedback from industry to formulate a policy to support the growth of the multimodal logistic sector and realise the investment potential, state finance and industry minister Amit Mitra said.
“Bengal is a very attractive proposition in logistics. Several companies have come in and set up logistic parks. The state has abundant land to offer to potential investors,” Mitra said in a colloquium organised by trade body CII.
Flipkart, owned by US retail giant Walmart, has taken a 100-acre plot at Haringhata in Nadia to build a logistic park. Hong Kong-based ESR, one of Asia Pacific’s leading logistic firms, is also setting up a park in Uluberia.
While the locational advantage — Bengal being the gateway to the Northeast and also a large consumption centre in itself — has always been there, introduction of GST has given a fillip to the logistic sector as companies are now setting up warehouses based on nearness to market rather than for tax benefit.

The Centre is also pushing to develop inland waterways to connect north India, Northeast and Bangladesh with Calcutta and Haldia port. Terminals are being built along the river Hooghly up to Benaras to allow loading and unloading of cargo.
The new policy plans to harness the inherent advantages and upcoming facilities. It will focus on integrating fragmented logistic sectors, driving efficiency in storage infrastructure, optimising land cost, fostering technology adoption and last mile connectivity and multimodal network.
The minister said 16 industrial parks have land to offer to investors, including 300 acres at Haldia and 500 acres each at Kharagpur and Panagarh, adding that are some of the fast developing locations are Durgapur, Siliguri, Malda, Dankuni and Tajpur.
Speaking later at the webinar, Vinit Kumar, chairman of Calcutta Port Trust, said ease of doing business, transparency and reliability are key to successful multi-modality models and building up a conducive ecosystem.
Kumar also spoke about an upcoming terminal in Balagarh which will be made operational in the next 2-3 months and a terminal in Sahebgunj. ""The Indo-Bangla coastal route including Myanmar holds a big potential for the Bengal logistics sector once the Sittwe port in Myanmar becomes operational,” the chairman informed.",business
Coal auction bids deferred," The due date to express interest to participate in the auction for coal blocks as part of commercial coal mining has been pushed back by over a month.
This comes at a time when several objections on ecological grounds have been raised at the Centre’s selection of certain blocks in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, resulting in the need to review the initially selected list of 41 coal blocks.
In a revised schedule of auction issued on Saturday, the due date for submission of technical bids is now set for September 29, 2020 with the actual auction being planned in the later part of October. The approval of successful bidders is expected by November. The earlier due date for submission of technical bids was August 18, 2020. A technically qualified bidder will subsequently participate in the financial bidding.
The government had initially selected 41 coal blocks with a total geological reserve of 16979 million tonnes under the first phase of commercial coal mine auction. The blocks spread across five states — Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha — included a mix of both large and small mines with peak rated capacities (PRC) ranging from 0.5 to to 40 million tonnes per annum.
The cumulative PRC for all mines is 225 million tonnes per annum, which is almost equivalent to the annual coal import in the country by volume.

The auction was formally announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 18, 2020. But following objections from the Maharashtra government for including the Bander coal mine and a part of the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve, an ecologically sensitive zone, the block was withdrawn from the auction process on July 17, 2020.
The Centre is also considering the Chhattisgarh government’s request for replacing five coal mines in the state with three other mines. This was after a meeting between Union coal minister Pralhad Joshi and state government officials last month. Some of the blocks were part of biodiversity-rich forest area.
Industry analysts are, however, concerned that if the bigger blocks in Chhattisgarh are replaced, it could affect bidder interest. In Odisha, bigger blocks such as Chendipada I and II (40mtpa) Machhakata (30mtpa) Brahmanbil and Kardabahal (25mtpa) are likely to attract bids. Coal India expects to end 2020-21 with an overall production of around 650-660 million tonnes in the wake of the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The miner had earlier set a production target of 710 mt for the fiscal.
“Demand has started to pick up now as the industries have commenced operations,” chairman Pramod Agrawal said at a webinar organised by Bharat Chamber of Commerce.
Given the situation, we are hopeful to end the year with 650-660 million tonne of production

Emami margins rise amid lockdown," FMCG player Emami has surprised the Street by expanding its margin and registering a growth in net profit in the first quarter despite a sharp drop in revenues as a lockdown caused disruptions in the business environment in April and May.
Gross margin increased by 230 basis points during April-June on a year-on-year basis, while the EBIDTA margin zoomed 487 bps compared with the same period a year ago.
Revenue was down 25.7 per cent to Rs 481.34 crore from Rs 648.64 crore a year ago, while profit after tax inched up 1.2 per cent to Rs 39.58 crore compared with Rs 39.12 crore in the June quarter of 2019. 
The Emami scrip jumped 8.14 per cent to close the week at Rs 257.65, a new three- month high, after the numbers were announced.
Mohan Goenka, director of Emami Limited, said the company is on a growth path from June onwards, including a double-digit jump in July. 
“Our margins grew because of the stringent cost control measures and all our new products performed well, particularly the personal hygiene and immunity building categories. Going forward, we expect the growth momentum to continue,” Goenka said. 
Emami made a slew of launches under the Zandu brand as consumers were spending more on wellness and immunity-boosting products during the pandemic. 
Edelweiss Research in a note said 43 per cent of Emami’s portfolio, which is aligned to the health and hygiene range, grew 29 per cent while the rest declined 44 per cent year-on-year. Harsh Agarwal, director of Emami, said the Zandu healthcare portfolio grew 23 per cent and new launches contributed 5 per cent to the revenue. 
“The discretionary products such as 7 Oils, Kesh King and Navratna,  which suffered during April and partially in May, have since recovered since May,” Agarwal said.
Even though the first quarter witnessed a dip in advertising by over 50 per cent, the company plans to spend as much as last year, indicating a higher adspend in the next three quarters. It will continue with a slew of launches. Birla Corporation’s June quarter profit fell 53 per cent to Rs 66 crore from Rs 141 crore a year ago. Revenues were also down 35 per cent to Rs 1,241 crore. Construction activities in urban areas have been affected because of a substantial reduction in workforce during the lockdown. 
Cash profit declined 44 per cent to Rs 172 crore in the first quarter from Rs 305 crore in the year-ago period. Bata India has suffered a consolidated net loss of Rs 100.88 crore for the June quarter of 2020 as sales were hit by the nationwide lockdown.

Uber suffers $1.78bn loss as Covid made millions stay at home," Uber lost $1.78 billion in the second quarter as the pandemic carved a gaping hole in its ride-hailing business, with millions of people staying home to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
Its food delivery business grew as more people ordered in, but that booming part of its business didn’t turn a profit. 
The San Francisco-based ride-hailing giant brought in $2.24 billion in revenue during the second quarter, down 27 per cent from the same time last year, on a constant currency basis, the company said on Thursday. 
Uber’s mobility business, which includes ride-hailing and micro-mobility options such as scooters and bikes, saw its revenue shrink to $790 million, down 67 per cent from $2.38 billion a year ago. 
“While we would have all hoped that by now we had a clear line of sight to the end of the pandemic, hope is not a strategy and it’s my job to ensure that Uber is well prepared for any scenario,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a conference call with investors on Thursday. 
Uber’s Eats delivery business — once just a fraction of the company — brought in $1.21 billion in revenue during the quarter. That was up 103 per cent from $595 million in last year’s second quarter. 
As some people stay closer to home, more people are ordering from Uber Eats than ever before, Khosrowshahi said. 
“The Covid crisis has moved delivery from a luxury to a utility,” he added. 
Gross bookings for Uber’s mobility business plummeted 73 per cent from the same quarter last year. 
Its delivery business grew 113 per cent on a constant currency basis, but did not turn a profit, instead losing about $232 million during the quarter. 
Uber’s quarterly losses included $382 million in restructuring and related charges as the company laid off 6,700 people — a quarter of its workforce — in May. 
Uber said at the time that it would be closing or consolidating 45 offices worldwide. Its revenue fell in the US and across the world except in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Uber said it still expects to become profitable sometime in 2021.",business
Mindspace REIT makes market debut at 10.5% premium," The successful launch of India’s second REIT with an issue size of Rs 4,500 crore and its listing on the bourses at more than 10 per cent premium on Friday will encourage more builders to monetise their rent yielding commercial assets through this route, according to industry experts. 
The units of the REIT listed at Rs 304, reflecting a gain of 10.54 per cent from the issue price on the BSE. During the day, it touched a high of Rs 308.90, zooming 12.32 per cent. Later, it closed at Rs 303.87, up 10.49 per cent. 
On the NSE, it closed at Rs 303, a gain of 10.18 per cent after debuting at Rs 302, a rise of 9.81 per cent.
The company's market valuation was at Rs 18,020.04 crore on the BSE. In volume terms, 18.45 lakh shares were traded on BSE and 2.70 crore on NSE. The Rs 4,500-crore public issue of Mindspace Business Parks REIT was subscribed nearly 13 times late last month.
The participation of retail investors will also increase in future REITs, enabling them to earn dividend income from fully leased and listed commercial real estate, they added.
Mindspace Business Parks REIT, which is owned by K Raheja and Blackstone, made its market debut on Friday, with a premium of nearly 11 per cent against its issue price of Rs 275 per unit. 
The units of the REIT are listed at Rs 304, reflecting a gain of 10.54 per cent from the issue price on the BSE.      
This is India’s second REIT. The first Embassy Office Parks got listed in April last year after raising Rs 4,750 crore. 
Commenting on the listing, Jonathan Gray, president and chief operating officer of Blackstone, said:
“Blackstone is honoured to be partners with the Rahejas to help create India’s second public REIT. Like Embassy last year, Mindspace has tremendous assets and a real commitment to producing shareholder value.”
Anarock chairman Anuj Puri said, “REITs are good news for investors who have a small appetite and yet want to invest in the otherwise highly cost-intensive commercial real estate (CRE) market. With REITs, they can literally take a small bite of the large Indian CRE pie.” ",business
Mahindra & Mahindra quarterly profit nearly wiped out," Mahindra & Mahindra saw its quarterly profit nearly wiped out as the Covid-19 pandemic hit the supply chain.

Mahindra & Mahindra to cut SsangYong stake," Mahindra & Mahindra has decided to reduce its stake in SsangYong Motor Company (SYMC) of South Korea to less than 50 per cent. It is also open to the possibility of ceding control over SYMC “in full or in part, at one time or over time”.
According to M&M’s annual report for 2019-20, as on  March 31 2020, its investments in SYMC stood at Rs 2,450 crore, while its ownership interest was at 74.65 per cent. 
In April this year, the board of M&M had rejected a proposal to inject any fresh equity into the Korean arm.
The management and labour union of SYMC had sought a funding of 500 billion won ($406 million) from the domestic auto major over the next three years. 
Mahindra had acquired SsangYong in 2010 but failed to turn it around despite several attempts.
In a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges, M&M said its board on Friday has agreed to take shareholder approval through postal ballot for the reduction its shareholding in SYMC to less than 50 per cent “and/or for cessation/extinguishment/change/modification of control of the company over SYMC, in full or in part at one time or over time”.
M&M added that it wanted  the approval so that it can induct potential investors into SYMC or to otherwise meet the funding requirements of SYMC through other sources.
Meanwhile, chairman Anand Mahindra said the Mahindra group will continue to invest in successful businesses and prepare for the future by nurturing and investing in verticals that have a potential of over a billion dollar market cap, while “appropriate action” is being taken on those that do not live up to expectations.
Addressing the company’s shareholders at the annual general meeting, Mahindra said the Covid-19 pandemic had turned lives upside down and the economy faces an uncertain future. 
He, however, added that it has given “us an opportunity to reboot our thinking, to reinvent our approach and to recommit ourselves to our financial goals”.

RBI's gold loan plan raises credit risk for banks," The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to raise the loan-to-value ratio on gold loans has sparked concerns about a higher credit risk for banks.

Gold prices have been rising but could moderate in the near future and an LTV of 90 per cent on the value could reduce the value of the collateral if the prices go down, analysts said. LTV is the proportion of the collateral gold, which can be financed by banks. 
The pandemic and the ensuing lockdown have devastated the world economy, raising the lure of gold as a safe haven asset.
However, Brickworks Rating said the RBI move raises the credit risk as the collateral available in the form of gold ornaments or jewellery may not be sufficient to fully cover both the principal and interest components of the loan.
“Gold loans would result in a negative carry for banks as the total exposure will exceed the value of the pledged gold. It could adversely impact the recoverability and asset quality in the case of a weakening in the borrower credit risk profile or sharp decline in prices,” Brickworks director Vydianathan Ramaswamy said.
The risk for banks is for a limited period as the scheme is valid till the end of this fiscal year. Besides, the loans are usually over a short period of three months to two years.
“With gold prices close to their peak a higher LTV does pose additional risk, and lenders may choose to offer the higher LTV to shorter tenure loans and to customers who have a higher credit score,” V. Swaminathan, joint president — government business & gold loans, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said.
Gold prices fell to Rs 55,845 after hitting a record high of Rs 56,191 per ten gram in intra-day trade on Friday.",business
RBI names four members to debt recast panel," The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday named four members to the KV Kamath committee which will work on the details of the one-time debt restructuring plan for individuals and companies having stressed accounts because of Covid-19. The debt recast plan will be introduced as soon as the loan moratorium ends on August 31.
Two of the four members chosen to the Kamath panel — Diwakar Gupta, vice-president of the Asian Development Bank, and Canara Bank chairman T.N. Manoharan — will join the panel after they finish their current assignments. 
While Gupta will join on September 1 after his tenure at the ADB ends, Manoharan will join earlier on August 14 after he completes his term as chairman of Canara Bank. The other two members  are Ashvin Parekh, managing partner at Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services, who will be the strategy adviser; and Sunil Mehta, CEO of the Indian Banks’ Association, will be the member secretary.
The panel will submit its recommendations to the central bank, which may make some modifications and notify the recommendations within a month.
The RBI on Thursday announced a debt recast plan for individuals and firms that have turned defaulters on account of Covid-19, which will be based on the norms of its resolution plans for  stressed assets released in June last year, called the Prudential Framework on Resolution of Stressed Assets issued on June 7, 2019. 
The panel will set the financial parameters for the resolution of the stressed assets. The recast panel will also undertake the process validation for the resolution plans in respect of all accounts with an aggregate exposure of Rs 1,500 crore and above at the time of  invocation. The RBI has said lending institutions should ensure the resolution under the one-time facility is extended only to borrowers facing stress in their accounts because of Covid-19. 
Accounts which do not fulfil the required eligibility conditions may be considered for resolution under the prudential mechanism of June 2019. 
On personal advances, the RBI said only those borrower accounts shall be eligible for resolution that were classified as standard but not in default for more than 30 days with the lending institution as on March 1, 2020. 
A resolution should be invoked not later than December 31, 2020 and must be implemented within 90 days from the date of  invocation.
For the other borrowers, the RBI had said if there are multiple lending institutions with exposure to the borrower, the  resolution process shall be treated as invoked if the institutions representing 75 per cent by value of the total outstanding credit facilities and not less than 60 per cent of lenders by number agree to the exercise.",business
Pledged gold to fetch more," Individuals can now borrow more against their gold jewellery.
The RBI on Thursday raised the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio in gold loans for non-agricultural purposes to 90 per cent from 75 per cent.
LTV is the proportion of the collateral value which can be financed. Thus, an LTV of 75 per cent means that banks and non-banks can lend up to 75 per cent of the value of the gold ornaments or jewellery pledged by an individual. This has now been raised to 90 per cent.
The central bank expects this enhanced LTV ratio will help borrowers tide themselves over their temporary liquidity mismatches on account of Covid  19. However, this relaxation will be available till March 31, 2021.
“Gold loan is an easy product and people can avail this loan over the counter within 30 minutes. At the same time banks and NBFCs will have to have strong risk management to ensure this easing is used effectively,’’ Saurabh Kumar, head of gold loans at IIFL Finance, said.
Non-banking finance companies and banks have a major share of the organised gold loan market.
Recently, IDBI Bank had announced the launch of four specialised gold loan branches as it looked to cash in on more individuals taking such loans. Equitas Small Finance Bank is also offering gold loans through easy documentation and instant cash. It is giving loans with an average ticket size in the range of Rs 30,000 to Rs 40 lakh. The maximum tenure for any scheme is 24 months.",business
RBI announces one-time loan restructuring mechanism," The RBI on Thursday conceded to a major demand of banks labouring under the burden of a moratorium scheme and announced a one-time loan restructuring mechanism.
This facility will be available to advances made to individual borrowers and corporate loans.
In a separate step, the central bank allowed banks to restructure their exposure to micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs).
Announcing the new framework, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das disclosed that the central bank will provide a window under the prudential framework spelt out in the June 7, 2019 circular to enable lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible corporate exposures without change in ownership and personal loans while classifying such exposures as standard “subject to specified conditions”.
Necessary safeguards will be built into this facility which will include prudent entry norms and clearly defined boundary conditions, specific binding covenants, independent validation and strict post-implementation performance monitoring, he added.
Only those borrower accounts shall be eligible for resolution that were classified as standard but not in default for more than 30 days with any lending institution as on March 1, 2020. The resolution plan may be invoked any time till December 31 and shall have to be implemented within 180 days from the date of invocation.
Lenders will have to keep additional provisions of 10 per cent of the post-resolution debt. There will be specific voting thresholds even for invocation of the resolution plan. Lenders who do not sign the inter-creditor agreement within 30 days will have to make a higher provision of 20 per cent.
An expert committee has been constituted under K.V. Kamath which shall make the recommendations on the required financial parameters, along with the sector specific benchmark ranges for such parameters, to be factored into each resolution plan.
Ficci president Sangita Reddy said they were happy with the measures announced towards the resolution of loans. “We keenly look forward to the details and execution,” Reddy said.
This expert panel will also have the responsibility of vetting the resolution plans to be implemented under this window in respect of all accounts where the aggregate exposure of the lending institutions at the time of invocation of the resolution process is Rs 1,500 crore and above.
A final notification in this regard shall be issued by the Reserve Bank after considering the recommendations.
While the loan moratorium scheme announced by the RBI will end on August 31, veteran bankers like Deepak Parekh of HDFC have been calling for a one-time restructuring scheme as bad loans could spike in the second half of the current fiscal even as extending the current moratorium could lead to moral hazard.
The RBI has itself projected that the gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio of banks may rise to 14.7 per cent by March 2021 if the macro-environment worsens further.
Under the June 2019 framework, any resolution plan that involves relaxation in terms of repayment to a stressed borrower would lead to an asset classification downgrade (banks would then have to make higher provisions), if it is not accompanied by a change in ownership.
The central bank said that it is coming out with the scheme as the Covid-19 pandemic could impair the entire recovery process, posing significant financial stability risks. However, the latest resolution window will be available only to those who are under stress because of the pandemic.
For personal advances, the resolution plan would include rescheduling of payments, conversion of any interest accrued, or to be accrued, into another credit facility, or, granting of moratorium, based on an assessment of income streams of the borrower, subject to a maximum period of two years. The moratorium period, if granted, would come into force immediately upon the implementation of the resolution plan.
In the case of other loans, if there are multiple lending institutions that have exposure to the borrower, the resolution process will be treated as invoked if these entities representing 75 per cent by value of the total outstanding credit facilities, and not less than 60 per cent of the lending institutions by number agree to invoke the plan.
“The loan book under moratorium stood at ~50 per cent at system level as on April 30, 2020 and almost all lenders have reported further decline in loan books under the second phase of moratorium. With expectations of further reduction in moratorium in coming months, and proposals to have necessary safeguards around these restructuring, we expect such loan restructuring is unlikely to exceed 5-8 per cent of the overall loans at system level,” Anil Gupta, sector head-financial sector ratings at Icra, said while commenting on the restructuring framework.
Das also said that restructuring of MSME debt would continue till March 31 next year to help alleviate the Covid-related stress on the sector. Here, the RBI stipulated that existing loans to MSMEs classified as standard may be restructured without a downgrade in the asset classification, subject to various conditions.
While the aggregate exposure, including non-fund based facilities, of banks and NBFCs to the borrower should not exceed Rs 25 crore as on March 1, 2020, the borrower’s account should also be a “standard asset” as on March 1, 2020.
Further, the borrowing entity should be GST-registered on the date of implementation of the restructuring. However, this condition will not apply to MSMEs that are exempt from GST-registration.",business
Inflation poses bigger threat to revival of tottering economy," The RBI on Thursday kept the policy repo rate unchanged as it wanted to cool down inflation before offering stimulants to revive a tottering economy.
All the members of the Monetary Policy Committee  (MPC) voted to keep the repo rate and reverse repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and 3.35 per cent, respectively, at the end of their three-day meet. 
Retail inflation was above 6 per cent in June, while the economic picture remained dismal with both industrial production and service sector activity showing contractions. The MPC forecast a negative GDP growth for the fiscal but did not commit itself to a specific number.
RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to achieve the medium-term target for CPI (consumer price index) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, despite the growth gloom.  “The MPC decided to keep the policy rate on hold while remaining watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use available space to support the revival of  economy.”
Das cited a number of reasons why inflation remained a major concern: food prices are high on account of the severe disruptions caused by the lockdown and the floods in eastern India. High taxes on petroleum products, hikes in telecom charges and rising raw material prices have generated cost-push inflation. “While space for further monetary policy action is available, it is important to use it judiciously to maximise the beneficial effects for underlying economic activity.’’ The RBI has cut the repo rate by a cumulative 115 basis points this year on top of a 135-basis-point-reduction last year. Das said the MPC chose to hit the pause button to allow commercial banks to play catch-up with its earlier cuts. “The cumulative reduction of 250 basis points is working its way through the economy, lowering interest rates in money, bond and credit markets, and narrowing down spreads,” Das said.
He said monetary transmission had been strong with the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declining  162 basis points during February 2019-June 2020, of which transmission during March-June was as much as 91 basis points.
“Spreads of 3-year AAA-rated corporate bonds over similar tenor government securities have also declined from 276 basis points on March 26, 2020 to 50 basis points on July 31, 2020.Even for the lowest investment grade bonds (BBB-), spreads have come down by 125 basis points as on July 31, 2020,” the RBI governor  said.
CII president Uday Kotak said the status quo in rates was understandable given the liquidirty deluge. Realtors, however, were disappointed. Surendra Surendra Hiranandani, chairman and managing director, House of Hiranandani. said the RBI needed to drastically and aggresively lower interest rates and make them ""enticing for home buyers.""",business
Banks get relief on mutual fund exposures," The RBI has reduced the amount of capital that banks must set aside while putting money in debt mutual funds and debt exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
According to the current guidelines, if a bank holds a debt instrument directly, it has to allocate a lower capital compared with holding the same debt instrument through a mutual fund.
At present, bank investment in these instruments are treated on a par with that in equities in terms of providing a specific risk capital because of which they have to set aside more funds. However, if the lender was to hold the debt instrument directly, a lower risk capital must be provided against the investment as they are done on the basis of the rating of the debt instrument.
RBI will now harmonise this differential treatment.
Murthy Nagarajan, head-fixed income, Tata Mutual Fund, says: “The move should see good amount of flows in the mutual fund industry and stabilise bond yields. Mutual funds normally sell in quarter ends to meet redemption request of banks. However, no measures in terms of increasing held-to-maturity Limits or an OMO calendar is a negative for the bond market.”
The relaxation will not only lead to more bank investment in debt mutual funds, but will also have a positive impact on the corporate bond markets, feels Unmesh Kulkarni, MD of Julius Baer India.
“The announcement to harmonize the capital charge (for market risk) treatment of investment by banks in debt mutual funds or ETFs and direct debt instruments, augurs well for the bond market, as there could be higher participation by banks in the bond markets over a period of time’’ Unmesh Kulkarni, Managing Director Senior Advisor, Julius Baer India said.
However, the RBI pointed out that since in the event of default of even one of the debt securities in its investment basket of a debt mutual fund, there could be severe redemption pressure, banks will have to maintain a `general market risk charge of 9 per cent’.
Despite this, the central bank added that when it comes to the total computation of capital charge, there will be substantial capital savings for banks which will also give a boost to the bond market.",business
RBI: Curbs on current account," The central bank on Thursday said that banks will not be allowed to open new current accounts for customers who have already availed themselves of credit facilities in the form of cash credit or overdraft and all transactions shall be routed through his existing account.
Cash credit (CC) is a short term loan, while overdraft (OD) is a type of funding where the customer can withdraw money by paying a certain interest even if his account balance is zero.
The move has been taken to instil credit discipline after the RBI noticed that many borrowers were circumventing rules by operating multiple current accounts and cash credit/overdraft accounts. In case of customers who have not availed of CC/OD facility from any bank, banks may open current accounts under specified rules: for borrowers where exposure to the banking system is Rs 50 crore or more, banks shall be required to put in place an escrow mechanism. Accordingly, current accounts of such borrowers can only be opened/maintained by the escrow managing bank.
However, there is no restriction on opening of “collection accounts” by lending banks if the funds are remitted from these accounts to the escrow account at the frequency agreed upon.
In case of borrowers where exposure to the banking system is Rs 5 crore or more but less than Rs 50 crore, there is no restriction on opening of current accounts by the lending banks.
Similarly, in cases exposure of the banking system is less than Rs 5 crore, banks may open current accounts subject to obtaining an undertaking that the customer will inform the bank, if and when the credit facilities availed becomes Rs 5 crore or more.
Where a bank’s exposure1 to a borrower is less than 10 per cent of the exposure of the banking system to that borrower, while credits are freely permitted, debits to the CC/OD account can only be for credit to the CC/OD account of that borrower with a bank that has 10 per cent or more of the exposure of the banking system to that borrower. Funds will be remitted from these accounts to the said transferee CC/OD account at the frequency agreed between the bank and the borrower.",business
"Vodafone loss widens to Rs 25,460 crore"," Vodafone Idea, the country’s third-largest telecom operator, on Thursday reported a sharp rise in its losses to Rs 25,460 crore for the April-June quarter of 2020-21 because of the high provisioning for statutory dues.
The losses stood at Rs 4,874 crore in the year-ago period.
Revenue from operations came in at Rs 10,659.3 crore for the first quarter of 2020-21 against Rs 11,269.9 crore in the same period of the previous year, according to a regulatory filing.
Net loss against exceptional items stood at Rs 5,537 crore.
The company said it has recognised an additional charge of Rs 19,440.5 crore in the June quarter towards adjusted gross revenue (AGR) liabilities.
“During this quarter, on prudence, we have recognised a charge of Rs 194.4 billion as an exceptional item towards the total estimated AGR liability, in addition to estimated recognised liability of Rs 460.0 billion as on March 31, 2020,” a company statement said.
Gross debt (excluding lease liabilities) stands at Rs 1,18,940 crore, including deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 92,270 crore due to the government. Cash and cash equivalents were Rs 3,450 crore and net debt stood at Rs 1,15,500 crore against Rs 1,12,520 crore in the fourth quarter of 2019-20, the operator said.
The company said the first-quarter numbers were impacted by the nationwide lockdown because of coronavirus.
Ravinder Takkar, MD and CEO of Vodafone Idea, said, “Q1FY21 was challenging as availability of recharges because of store closures and ability of customers to recharge on account of the economic slowdown were impacted.”
“We have launched a cost optimisation initiative that will drive further cost-savings. We also continue to actively engage with the government seeking a comprehensive relief package for the industry, which faces critical challenges,” he added.
The average revenue per user (ARPU) declined to Rs 114 in the April-June quarter from Rs 121 in the January-March quarter. Rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have reported good traction from tariff hikes introduced in the third quarter of 2019-20. Bharti’s ARPU has increased 22.7 per cent since the second quarter of 2019-20, while Jio’s ARPU is up 16.9 per cent.",business
Bata turns austere on capex plan," Footwear major Bata will remain conservative on capital expenditure and expansion as the pandemic-induced lockdown has affected demand for shoes and led to a decline in footfall at  the company’s retail stores. 
With more than 1,500 stores, Bata will evaluate the expansion of its own stores and prefer to go more for the franchisee model.
In manufacturing, the company had invested around Rs 11 crore for the upgradation and modernisation of its manufacturing unit at Batanagar in Bengal last year. But unlike the usual capex spend, the focus this year would be on managing the existing capacity of 21 million footwear pairs per annum along with cost control initiatives.
The company is also realigning its product offering to cater to the increasing demand for open and washable footwear and expanding its e-commerce presence.
“A substantial part of the renovation and modernisation is done. The situation right now is unique. We have capacity available and at the same time we don’t want to lose out on the surge in demand when the market recovers,” Ashwani Windlass, chairman of Bata India, told The Telegraph on Thursday, adding that the company would not go “too boldly out” for capex at present.
Addressing shareholders at the annual general meeting of Bata India, Windlass said, “Given the social distancing norms and the shift to work-from-home, there would also be an impact on lifestyle products and, accordingly, on the company,”adding that the actual demand recovery will be concurrent with the overall economic situation.
“There is still some more time to go before we can see a complete reinstatement of pre-Covid state of affairs,” Windlass said.
The company, however, remains optimistic about the end-of-season sale and the upcoming festive season with expectations of higher footfall.
“Our omni-channel home delivery offerings cover more than 900 stores pan India. We are continuously ramping up our online presence across India. We have also realigned our product offerings to cater to the demand for open footwear and washable footwear,” he said.",business
Eveready rating gets an upgrade," Eveready Industries has received the first “upgrade” after a gap of three years from credit rating agency India Ratings & Research (Ind-Ra), signalling a directional change for the dry cell battery maker which has been bogged down by group debt problems.
Ind-Ra, a Fitch Group company, cited improving profitability led by growth in the battery business and improving credit matrix apart from increasing stake by the Burman family as the key drivers.
The EIL stock touched a fresh 52-week high on the bourses on Thursday, closing the session with a gain of Rs 6.65 at Rs 139.80 on the NSE, after hitting the upper circuit ceiling of 4.99 per cent. The stock has rallied 73 per cent from the end of July 13, a day before the Burman family of Dabur raced past the promoter group to become the largest shareholder of EIL. The Burmans now have a shade under 20 per cent in Eveready compared with a little over 15 per cent held by the promoters.
Ind-Ra upgraded the long term issuer rating by one notch to ‘Ind-BB+’ from ‘Ind-BB’ with a positive outlook. The BB rating indicates elevated vulnerability to default risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic condition over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists that supports the servicing of financial commitments.
“The upgrade reflects EIIL’s improved liquidity position aided by deleveraging in 2HFY20, coupled with sustained profitability in FY20. The positive outlook reflects Ind-Ra’s expectations of a further improvement in EIIL’s business profile and its liquidity position in FY21, backed by the improving performance of its battery and flashlight segments, a possible resolution of the contingent liability issue and the possibility of a managerial/board representation by the Burmans.” Ind-Ra said.
The last upgrade Eveready received was on August 9, 2017 when Ind-Ra had profiled it at ‘Ind AA-’. The company witnessed multiple downgrades in 2019 as the promoters — the Khaitan family of Williamson Magor Group — got trapped in a downward debt spiral.
They borrowed heavily on the strength of the balance sheets of EIL and McLeod Russel and by pledging their shares in these two firms and lent forward to cover the losses in McNally Bharat Engineering Co Ltd.
Noting expansion of margin due to combination of factors — benign commodity prices, sharp decrease in imports from China leading to increased product prices — Ind-Ra expects EIIL’s profitability to continue to improve in FY21 on the increased contribution from the battery and flashlight businesses and the discontinuation of the loss-making tea business.",business
RBI: Priority loans for start-ups," The RBI on Thursday brought start-ups under the priority sector lending (PSL) category as it looked to encourage bank investment in this segment.
The surprise move from the central bank comes after the government tightened foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for firms or entities who share a border with India as it sought to monitor investments from Chinese firms, which according to reports have funded more than two dozen start-ups in India.
While the RBI did not disclose details, it said tersely in the statement that it is broadening the scope of PSL to include start-ups.
The PSL guidelines were last reviewed in April 2015. The central bank added that these guidelines have been reviewed with a view to align them with emerging national priorities and bring sharper focus on inclusive development.
Apart from facilitating banking support to start-ups, the RBI said it would increase the credit borrowing limits for renewable energy sectors and the targets for lending to “small and marginal farmers” and the “weaker sections” under PSL.
Under PSL, eligible entities get access to credit on easier terms from banks. Banks are required to assign 40 per cent of the adjusted net bank credit to the priority sector, including agriculture and micro-enterprises.
Despite the RBI relaxation, it remains to be seen if start-ups will turn to banks apart from other sources such as incubators, angel investors or venture capital funds.
At present, lenders such as Bank of India (BoI) provide funding to start-ups (having turnover of up to Rs 25 crore or not completed five years) up to Rs 5 crore.
“Shortage of risk capital in India had led the foreign private equity to fund most Indian start-ups. Inclusion of start-ups in the priority sector lending category is a welcome move,” Navneet Munot, chief investment officer of SBI Mutual Fund, said.",business
RBI set to offer loan resolution mechanism," The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday decided to keep interest rates unchanged, forecast negative real GDP growth for the year and braced for elevated inflation in the second quarter.
The RBI signalled that there would be no extension of the loan moratorium regime beyond August 31 but decided to put in place a loan resolution mechanism with some tough conditions to address concerns within the banking sector over a looming bad loan crisis.
A committee headed by banking doyen K.V. Kamath will recommend the financial parameters and relevant thresholds that will be factored into the resolution plans, Das said.
Eligible corporate borrowers and individuals who have taken personal loans will be able to invoke the resolution plan at any time till December 31 but must implement it within 180 days.
The priority sector lending guidelines will be rejigged to remove regional disparities in the flow of credit while the ambit of the programme is being widened to cover start-ups.
Borrowers who pledge gold ornaments with banks and non-banking finance entities will be entitled to get higher loans as the loan-to-value ratio is being raised to 90 per cent from 75 per cent earlier.",business
IRDAI is scrapping the long-term car insurance policy - know if your insurance is still valid," In the purview of the misuse of the long-term car and bike insurance policies by the car/bike dealers, the Insurance Regulator and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has withdrawn all long-term third-party plans that offer both third-party and own damage coverage. The vehicle dealers used the three-year and five-year policies to increase the prices of the new vehicles and tried to force sell the plans to vehicle buyers.
Another reason for the withdrawal of the long-term car insurance plans, as suggested by many experts, is the structure of the NCB (no claim bonus) of the long-term policies, which was not clear, which led to confusion among customers.
The long-term car insurance plan was introduced in September 2018 as per the orders of the honourable Supreme Court of India. Earlier, the apex court had directed the insurance companies to offer a three-year or a five-year policy covering both third-party liability and own damage or a plan with a third-party component for long-term and own damage for one year.
In June 2020, the IRDA issued a circular addressed to all insurance companies in India to withdraw the long-term covers with effect from August 1, 2020. The customers welcome the move to withdraw the long-term plans as it is expected to bring down the car prices in India.
The Implication of the new rule for new insurance buyers
With the new rule of scrapping the long-term comprehensive policy coming into effect from August 2020, if you are planning to buy a new bike or a car, you will be paying less. Also, the cost of first-year insurance for the new vehicle will come down.
Additionally, the new rule will ensure that you need not have to continue holding your policy with the same insurance company even if you are not satisfied with the services. You can now switch your plan to another insurance of your choice while renewing the plan after one year.
The Implication of the new rule for existing customers
If you hold a long-term car insurance policy that covers both third-party and own damage, you must know that the long-term TP liability cover will continue to remain mandatory, and your insurance cover will remain valid. If you are unhappy with the services of the insurer or if you think the premium is too high, you can switch your own damage component to a new insurer at the time of renewal.
The features and the coverage for both the own damage and the third-party components will remain the same, just that with the new rule coming into effect, the own damage part will be limited to one year.
If you are worried about what will happen to the accumulated NCB, you can retain the same when you renew the policy with any other insurer of your choice. The NCB will be provided as per the India Motor Tariff, and it will depend upon the yearly claim made by you within the long-term policy.",business
"France, Germany and US flights to start"," The Centre on Thursday sketched a flight plan for foreign airlines following US action against the chartered flights being carried out by Air India, a facility denied to the American carriers.
India has now established individual bilateral bubbles with France, Germany and the US that will allow airlines of each country in the pact to operate international flights, said the civil aviation ministry on Thursday.
Air France will be operating 28 flights between Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Paris from July 18 to August 1, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said at a press conference.
American carrier United Airlines will be flying 18 flights between India and the US from July 17 to 31, he said.
“They (United) are flying a daily flight between Delhi and Newark and a thrice-a-week flight between Delhi and San Francisco,” Puri said.
The minister on Thursday said India is planning to establish a bubble with the UK soon under which there would be two flights a day between Delhi and London.
On Thursday, the civil aviation ministry issued a statement that said, “Air bubbles established with US, France and Germany... Lufthansa will also be operating (flights).”
From India, Air India will be operating the flights to France, Germany and the US under these bubbles.
On July 9, India had announced an air bubble with the UAE that would be in place from July 12 to 26.
Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23.
On the cap on domestic airfare amid the coronavirus pandemic, Puri said he feels it  needs to continue for a while. On the decision to send certain Air India employees on leave without pay for up to five years, Puri said: “Equity infusion of the kind of Rs 500-600 crore every year is not a sustainable way to run an airline now. Everybody has to cut costs. That is what is happening here.”
He said even if Air India wants financial assistance from the government now, it may not be possible for the government to help the carrier as it has to meet other demands such as providing relief to vulnerable sections of society. The price of jet fuel was raised on Thursday by 1.5 per cent, the fourth increase in six weeks, while petrol and diesel rates were unchanged.
The aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price was hiked by Rs 635.47 per kilolitre (kl), or 1.5 per cent, to Rs 42,628.28 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification by state-owned oil marketing companies. This is the fourth straight increase in ATF prices in six months.
“This is my personal view,” Puri said. The price cap on domestic flight tickets is in place till at least August 24.
The government had in May allowed resumption of domestic flight operations but had set limits on airfares, categorising them into seven bands as per the flight durations.
After nearly two months of suspension to combat the coronavirus outbreak, the government resumed scheduled domestic passenger flights on May 25.
However, it had then allowed the airlines to operate maximum 33 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights.
The ministry of civil aviation increased the limits on June 26 from 33 per cent to 45 per cent.
“We are assuming that by the time Diwali comes this year, we would have 55-60 per cent of pre-Covid domestic flights operating in India,” Puri said at the press conference.
I had imagined we would reach 33 per cent of our domestic capacity by July 15 but we have not, the minister said.
Various states like Maharashtra have put restrictions on the number of flights that their airports can handle per day, he said, adding that he expects this would change in coming 2-3 weeks.
He said once the domestic capacity reaches 50-55 per cent of its pre-COVID capacity, the government will get the confidence about opening international air travel further.            The fact of the matter is that international flights will take place between bigger metros in India and outside locations, the minister mentioned.     Giving the example of the Mumbai airport, he said if more international flights are allowed to Mumbai, those passengers will need forward flights to go to other places in India but that will be a constraint as the airport handles only 50 flights per day.
The India-UAE air bubble was permitted on July 9 under specific conditions.
Charter flights operated by the UAE carriers have been permitted to bring Indian citizens from the UAE to India and carry “ICA-approved UAE residents” on their return leg, said the Civil Aviation Ministry.

"ED files money laundering case against GVK group, MIAL in Mumbai airport scam"," The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a money laundering case against the GVK group, the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) and others to probe alleged irregularities to the tune of Rs 705 crore in running the Mumbai airport, officials said on Tuesday.

The central probe agency has filed an enforcement case information report (equivalent of a police FIR) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act after studying a recent CBI FIR filed against the same entities.

The ED will probe if genuine funds were laundered to amass personal assets by illegal routing of funds, they said.

The CBI case pertains to the alleged siphoning off Rs 705 crore from the funds of the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), a joint venture under public-private partnership (PPP) between the GVK Airport Holdings Limited and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) besides other investors, by showing inflated expenditure, under-reporting of revenues, fudging of records among others

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked Gunupati, a director in MIAL, his son GV Sanjay Reddy, managing director in MIAL, the companies MIAL, GVK Airport Holdings Limited (a GVK group company) and nine other private companies allegedly used to camouflage the inflated figures through sham deals and unidentified AAI officials, they added.

On April 4, 2006, the AAI entered into an agreement with MIAL for the modernisation, upkeep, operation and maintenance of the Mumbai airport.

It is alleged that the promoters of the GVK group in MIAL, in connivance with their executives and unidentified AAI officials, resorted to siphoning off funds using different ways, the CBI had said early this month.

The CBI had also carried out raids in Mumbai and Hyderabad after filing its FIR.",business

"CBI books GVK Group chairman, son for siphoning off over Rs 700 cr from Mumbai Int Airport Ltd","   The CBI has booked Venkata Krishna Reddy Gunupati, chairman of the GVK Group of Companies and his son G.V. Sanjay Reddy, managing director of Mumbai International Airport Ltd, among others for alleged irregularities to the tune of Rs 705 crore in running of the airport, officials said.

Airports Authority of India (AAI) Ltd had formed a Joint Venture with GVK Airports Holdings Limited, promoted by GVK group under public private partnership firm Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) for upgradation and maintenance of Mumbai Airport.

On April 4, 2006 AAI entered into an agreement with MIAL for modernisation, upkeep, operation and maintenance of Mumbai airport.

It is alleged that promoters of GVK group in MIAL in connivance with their executives and unidentified officials of AAI resorted to siphoning off funds using different ways, officials said on Wednesday.

The agency has alleged that they siphoned off funds showing execution of bogus work contracts to nine companies in 2017-18 causing a loss of Rs 310 crore.

The promoters of GVK group allegedly misused reserve funds of MIAL to the tune of Rs 395 crore to finance their group companies, the CBI has alleged.

The agency has alleged that the group inflated expenditure figures of MIAL by showing payments to employees at their headquarters and group companies who were not involved in the running of MIAL, causing a revenue loss to AAI, they said.

The promoters allegedly under-reported revenue earnings of MIAL by entering into contracts with related parties and meeting their personal and family expenses using MIAL funds, they said.

Besides GVK group chairman, the CBI has also booked his son GV Sanjay Reddy who is Managing Director of MIAL, companies MIAL, GVK Airport Holdings Ltd, nine other private companies and unidentified officials of AAI, they said.",business
"India to ban Chinese companies from highway projects, says Gadkari"," India will not allow Chinese companies to participate in highway projects, including those through joint ventures, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday amid border standoff with China.

Gadakri also said the government will ensure that Chinese investors are not entertained in various sectors like Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).

The senior minister's assertions assume significance against the backdrop of border standoff between India and China in Ladakh that also saw the death of 20 Indian Army personnel last month.

Amid escalating tensions, the government on Monday banned 59 apps, mostly having Chinese links, citing threats to national security.

""We will not give permission to joint ventures that have Chinese partners for road construction. We have taken a firm stand that if they (Chinese companies) come via joint venture in our country, we will not allow it,"" Gadkari told PTI in an interview.

The road transport, highways and MSME minister said a policy will be out soon banning Chinese firms and relaxing norms for Indian companies to expand their eligibility criteria for participation in highway projects.

Currently, only a few projects which were undertaken much earlier involve some Chinese partners. When asked about this, the minister said that the new decision will be implemented in current and future tenders.

With respect to existing tenders and future bids, Gadkari said rebidding would be done if there are any Chinese joint ventures.

""We have taken a decision to relax norms for our companies to ensure that they qualify in bidding in large projects. I have directed the highways secretary (Giridhar Aramane) and NHAI chairman (S.S. Sandhu) to hold a meeting for relaxing technical and financial norms so that our companies can qualify to work,"" he said.

Elaborating on the decision, Gadkari said if a contractor can qualify for a small project, he can also qualify for a large project. ""Construction norms are not good so I have asked to change it. We are changing it so that we can encourage Indian companies,"" he added.

According to him, qualification norms for projects are being rationalised to ensure Indian companies do not require to enter into pacts with foreign partners to grab projects.

""Even if we have to go for foreign joint venture in the areas of technology, consultancy or design, we will not allow Chinese,"" the minister said.

About the MSME sector, Gadkari said the effort is to enhance the capacity of local production but at the same time foreign investment is being promoted.

However, he made it clear that despite decision to encourage foreign investment, Chinese investors would not be allowed.

""For upgradation of technology, research, consultancy and other works, we will encourage foreign investment and joint ventures in MSMEs but in case of Chinese we will not entertain them,"" he said.

On stopping of consignments from China at Indian ports, the minister said there is ""no arbitrary stopping of goods"" at Indian ports and the government is initiating path-breaking reforms to help MSMEs and businesses in a bid to make the country self-reliant.

""It is a good step. The imports from China will be discouraged and the country will take large strides towards self-reliance,"" the minister said and added that he is among the strongest proponents of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat'.

Gadkari said that he had urged departments concerned to expedite clearance of consignments which were booked two to three months in advance before the situation took its present shape.

After a representation from a farmers and traders' body that imported agriculture equipment consignments were delayed at ports, Gadkari in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal had sought early clearance of the said consignments.

There are reports that customs authorities at Chennai and Vishakhapatnam ports are conducting extra scrutiny of consignments from China.

Gadkari, as per the information, did not mention the name of the country from where these equipment were imported.

""Indian business has the strength and skills to grow further and power our journey towards self-reliance. Under strong leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the Government of India is proactive and initiating path-breaking reforms that will help businesses and MSMEs,"" he said.

Most of these equipment, as per the information, pertain to spraying devices for pesticide control as the same had been diverted to urban areas during the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.

Amid heightened border tensions with China, Indian customs officials have started physical inspection of all consignments coming from the neighbouring country specially Chennai and Vishakhapatnam ports.",business

Khaitan lenders offload shares," Taking advantage of a recent spurt in the stock prices of three frontline manufacturing companies of Calcutta’s Khaitan family, lenders have started invoking pledged shares again.
DMI Finance Private Ltd, a Delhi-based non-banking finance company, which held the pledged shares of Eveready Industries Ltd, McLeod Russel India Ltd and McNally Bharat Engineering Co Ltd, invoked a part of the promoters’ shares with it in all the three companies earlier this month. Consequently, the effective holding of the promoter Khaitan family slipped further in all the three companies.
DMI, where the Burman family of FMCG major Dabur holds a stake, sold the most in troubled engineering firm McNally where it invoked 3.57 per cent. It invoked 1.18 per cent in bulk tea producer McLeod and 0.83 per cent in battery, flashlight and appliance maker Eveready.
Following this, promoter holding in Eveready, the best performer and the least indebted in the group — founded by late Brij Mohan Khaitan — became the least among the three companies. The family, represented primarily by BM’s son Aditya Khaitan and grandson Amritangshu, holds a shade over 22 per cent in the company down from 44.11 per cent as on March 31, 2019. By the end of the last fiscal, promoter holding was down to 22.99 per cent as the lenders who held the company’s shares as collateral/pledge in lieu of loan extended to the promoters or promoter group companies invoked those shares incessantly. During the January-March quarter, promoter holdings were shaved off by 5 per cent.
While Burman-backed DMI, founded in 2008 by former Citigroup executives Shivashish Chatterjee & Yuvarja Singh, trimmed its stake, the Burman family’s direct holding in Eveready rose to 9.26 per cent by March 2020.
There has been speculation that the Burmans may invest in Eveready further, take up a board berth and manage the company with the Khaitans. The stock closed at Rs 78.2 on Friday, gaining 59 per cent in the last three months and close to a 52-week high of Rs 88.45.
The management has maintained that it was exploring a comprehensive restructuring of the outstanding group debt with the lenders who appointed SBI Caps to work out a deal. However, nothing has come out of it as yet. The plan included selling non-core assets and the infusion of fresh funds.
The company’s board will meet on July 1 to finalise the fourth-quarter results and declare dividends, if possible.
Promoters held 37.89 per cent as on March 31, 2020, in McNally where shares rallied to close at Rs 5.55 on Friday, more than doubling (Rs 2.3 on March 27) in the last three months and close to a 52-week high of Rs 6.11. It, however, cancelled a proposed board meeting to declare the result.
Investors in McLeod, where 98.16 per cent of the 27 per cent holding of the promoters were pledged as on March 31, got a spectacular 347 per cent return in the last three months, allowing lenders like DMI to invoke their shares. The stock closed at Rs 8.51 on Friday. The recent spurt in tea prices, backed by crop loss during lockdown, reflected on the stock rally.",business
Storm ahead? Get yourself covered," The nature and severity of natural and man-made disasters have been increasing globally. Natural calamities are now occurring at an unnatural frequency wherein cyclones, floods, earthquakes, which used to be a once-in-a-10-year phenomenon, are now an occurrence every year. India particularly is prone to natural calamities such as earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and cyclones.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), more than 40 million hectares or 12 per cent of the country’s land is prone to floods and river erosion.
Disasters seriously threaten India’s economy, its population and sustainable development, mainly because of its increasing vulnerabilities related to changing demographics, socio-economic conditions, unplanned urbanisation and global warming.
Natural disasters are often devastating, unavoidable and uncontrollable. In the recent past we saw calamities such as the Kerala floods and Cyclone Fani causing massive destruction to several houses and vehicles.
Similar is the situation today, where because of Cyclone Amphan many people are stranded and have incurred huge losses because of damages to their assets.
However, insurance is a tool that can help you recuperate from the damages caused because of these disasters. In the case of natural disasters in India, there is a vast difference between the economic losses and insured losses. This is mainly because of the “nothing will happen to me attitude” of people, and also, the lack of awareness about the importance of insurance. Here are a few insurance covers that one must have to protect oneself, one’s family members and their hard-earned assets.
Protect your homes
One of the biggest loss that a person can incur because of a natural disaster is any damage to his or her home. However, it is unfortunate that, despite paying high EMIs and investing their savings in it, most people give little priority to protecting their house with home insurance.
Home insurance is a step towards protecting your home against the threats that natural calamities pose, where you not only shield the structure of your house, but also the contents within. Insuring your home keeps you free from worries in such challenging times while also ensuring a swift revival to normalcy.
Home insurance is inexpensive especially when compared to other means that one invests in to secure their home or property. One can buy this policy for a year or for a longer period and customise it according to one’s needs.
Health first
Health insurance is a must have in today’s age as previously unheard of ailments are affecting masses and a steep increase in medical costs is making it difficult for people to access quality medical treatments.
During natural disasters, especially in the case of flooding, there is an increased risk of infections and outbreak of communicable diseases and waterborne diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, leptospirosis and vector borne diseases such as malaria, dengue. Hence, it is crucial to have an adequate health insurance that covers medical expenses and ensures that you can access quality healthcare services whenever in need.
Comprehensive motor cover
While most vehicles plying on Indian roads may have a third party liability cover as it is mandated by law, not many vehicles have a comprehensive motor insurance which also covers damages to the vehicles.
Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes etc can cause severe damage to your vehicle. Such damages to the vehicle due to natural calamities are covered under the own damage (OD) section of a comprehensive motor insurance policy. It is crucial to have a comprehensive motor insurance policy as the extent of the damage can vary from a minor crack in the windshield to a total damage of the vehicle.
Additionally, it is advisable to opt for necessary add-on covers along with a comprehensive motor insurance policy like an engine protector, depreciation shield, 24x7 roadside assistance that enhance the coverage of your vehicle.
These natural calamities are certainly an eye opener for many and some people do realise the importance of having insurance during such times. However, there are very few who actually buy insurance, as in most cases once the effect of the calamity reduces, so does the interest of people in insurance.
Natural disasters like most other risks we face are unpredictable. Hence, it is advisable to be prepared for it with necessary insurance covers so that you are not defenceless against disasters and are able to manage losses, without dipping into your hard-earned life savings and investments.

Tips to lure investment from China," Global investors will closely watch the performance of the Indian administration in addressing the challenges faced in the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking amid the global geopolitical tension involving China.
“You have to ask this question — why Vietnam is doing so well, why Korea and Taiwan have done so well. It is because of the ease of doing business in those places. So it’s very important for India to look at that,” said Mark Mobius, co-founder Mobius Capital Partners, at a webinar organised by IFA Global.
India stands 63rd among 190 economies ranked by the World Bank on ease of doing business. While the country has moved up 14 places , there are areas such as enforcing contracts (163) and registering property (154) where it lags.
“If the administration in India could do something to study that index and solve the various items on that index that makes it difficult to do business in India, then they would take off,” said Mobius.
He listed three areas that are in the focus of investors — the large domestic market, the substantial number of English speaking people who can work in any part of the world and an administration willing to undertake reforms.
“Consumer-oriented industries and by that I mean not only products but services as well, educational services, health services and software services are currently interesting and given the push for infrastructure spending that is another area companies would look at,” Mobius said. ",business
PNB to sell real estate," PNB has no plans to sell its non-core assets, including subsidiaries, in the current financial year, managing director of the bank S. S. Mallikarjuna Rao said.
However, the bank intends to sell some of its real estate assets and properties, including its old headquarter building.
“We have a lot of real estate assets because of the merger (of UBI, Oriental bank with the bank). We are planning to sell some of them. We are planning to sell a good amount of these assets by the end of the third quarter provided the market is available. We will not be selling at a discounted price,” he said.
PNB has a number of associates like PNB Housing Finance Ltd with a 32.65 per cent stake and PNB MetLife with 30 per cent shares.
After the merger of Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) with PNB beginning April 1, it has some more associates in its fold, including Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance with a 23 per cent stake.
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has given PNB permission to continue to hold both the companies, Rao said, adding that the lender will retain stake in both PNB MetLife and Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance.
Pacts terminated
Last year, PNB terminated the agreements with General Atlantic Group and Varde Partners to sell its stake in PNB Housing Finance (PNBHF). The bank had said it will continue to be the sole promoter of PNB Housing Finance post the termination of the pacts, and stay strategically invested in its housing finance arm.
Of the two agreements, the one with Varde Partners was terminated mutually, while the contract with General Atlantic Group was discontinued in the absence of regulatory approvals.
According to sources, the decline in the market cap of PNB Housing Finance in the aftermath of the IL&FS crisis was considered to be one of the primary reasons for aborting the deal.
MSME support
PNB has sanctioned Rs 6,757 crore in 2,96,753 eligible MSME accounts under the Guaranteed Emergency Credit Line (GECL), of which disbursements have been made to 59,204 accounts amounting to Rs 2,030 crore as on June 25. Of this, disbursement in 59,204 accounts amounting to Rs 2,030 crore have taken place, Rao said.
“PNB values its MSME customers and the bank will support them through this crisis. This year we commit our support to overcome this crisis and reignite the country’s economy,” he said.
MSMEs are in need of urgent credit to reinitiate their working capital and business operation. These units have suffered losses and were unable to pay the previous loan because of the current economic distress. ",business
Max planes to undergo tests," Pilots and test crew members from the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing Co are slated to begin a three-day certification test campaign for the 737 MAX on Monday, sources told Reuters.
The test is a pivotal moment in Boeing’s worst-ever corporate crisis, long since compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic that has slashed air travel and jet demand.
The grounding of the fast-selling 737 MAX in March 2019 after crashes killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia triggered lawsuits, investigations by Congress and the Department of Justice and cut off a key source of Boeing’s cash.
After a preflight briefing over several hours, the crew will board a 737 MAX 7 outfitted with test equipment at Boeing Field near Seattle, one of the people said.
The crew will run methodically scripted mid-air scenarios such as steep-banking turns, progressing to more extreme maneuvers on a route primarily over Washington state. The plan over at least three days could include touch-and-go landings at the eastern Washington airport in Moses Lake, and a path over the Pacific Ocean coastline, adjusting the flight plan and timing as needed for weather and other factors, one of the people said.
Pilots will also intentionally trigger the reprogrammed stall-prevention software, known as MCAS, faulted in both crashes, and aerodynamic stall conditions, the people said.
Boeing and the FAA declined to comment. The test goes beyond previous Boeing test flights, completed in a matter of hours on a single day, industry sources say. ",business
Rules for Covid cover," Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has come out with the guidelines for two health insurance policies specifically providing cover against Covid-19.
Called as the “Corona Kavach Policy” and the “Corona Rakshak Policy”, insurers have been told to offer these plans to individuals by July 10.
Irdai said the policies should be offered for three-and-a-half months, six-and-a-half months, and nine-and-a-half months.
The sum insured for the Corona Kavach Policy (succeeded by the name of the insurance company), which is a standard indemnity-based Covid-19 policy, would range from Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakh (in multiples of Rs 50,000).
A standard indemnity plan is one which reimburses an individual’s hospitalisation expenses incurred by the individual up to the sum insured.
The mode of payment would be single premium.
The policy, the regulator said, should also include the cost of treatment for any co-morbid condition along with the treatment of coronavirus.
The insurers can also offer optional cover (available on a benefit basis) wherein they will pay 0.5 per cent of the sum insured per day for each 24 hours of continuous hospitalisation for the treatment of Covid-19. This benefit will be payable maximum up to 15 days during a policy period. The minimum entry age is 18 years and the maximum age will not be less than 65 years for all the insured members, including the principal insured.
The second plan — Corona Rakshak Policy— will be made available on a benefit basis. The minimum sum assured has been set at Rs 50,000 and a maximum at Rs 2.50 lakh. Individuals have to pay a lump sum amount, irrespective of the expenses incurred in hospitalisation. While the policy period will be the same as Corona Kavach, Irdai said that on payment of 100 per cent of the sum insured, the policy will be terminated.
“These Covid-19 specific policies are a good start and may later encourage people to opt for more comprehensive health insurance covers,” said Rashmi Nandargi, head-retail health underwriting, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. ",business
Uco Bank plans to raise funds," Public sector lender Uco Bank is expecting an 8-10 per cent credit growth rate for 2020-21 and an improvement of its net interest margin (NIM) to the range of 2.6-2.75 per cent by March 31, 2021.
The city-based bank has posted a profit of Rs 16.78 crore in the fourth quarter of 2019-20 coming back to black after 17 quarters of losses since September 2015. Gross advances as of March 31, 2020 were Rs 11,4961 crore. Domestic advances posted a year on year decline of 5.62 per cent but overseas advances grew 21.30 per cent growth.
“We are expecting 8-10 per cent credit growth. The bank’s NIM is around 2.58. We are thinking of increasing this to the range of 2.6 to 2.75 per cent for 2020-21. The strategy is to increase current account and savings account deposits, engage in quality lending and go to the market for good customers,” said Uco Bank MD and CEO AK Goel.
Goel said the capital adequacy ratio of 11.7 per cent is above the threshold limit of 10.25 per cent under the RBI’s prompt corrective action framework.
The bank is also in compliance with other parameters such as net NPA and leverage ratio. The return on assets has also turned positive. He said any decision on the bank coming out of the framework would be taken by the RBI. The bank had come under PCA three years ago.
Based on the growth trajectory in the first three quarters, the bank may hit the capital market in the fourth quarter of the fiscal.
“There are several aspects to consider. If we get three good quarters of growth, we would be in a better position. Also, by December this year we would have a clear picture of the impact of Covid-19 before we take a call on raising funds from the market,"" he said.
Goel also remained hopeful that despite no new cases being admitted to the NCLT for time being, the accounts that have already been approved could be recovered by the bank. “If by March 31, 2021, we are able to recover the approved accounts, we will be in a comfortable position,” he said",business

Market leader Maruti sees an opportunity for CNG and it plans to sell about 1.5 lakh CNG vehicles this year. It had witnessed a six per cent growth in the sales of its CNG vehicles last year. Maruti offers 10 of its models in CNG but plans to bring more of models under the clean fuel.
“We believe the CNG is a good option when prices of both diesel and petrol are rising. The running cost of a CNG vehicle at Rs 2 per km is much cheaper than a petrol or a diesel vehicle. And the CNG cars are cheaper than BS-VI diesel cars. A factory-fitted CNG vehicle is Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 dearer than a petrol car,” said Shashank Srivastava, executive director, MSIL, speaking to The Telegraph.
However, there are only 1,700 CNG stations in the country at present. The government has plans to expand this to 3,400 stations by the end of this year covering about 370 cities from 160 cities now.
Maruti has eight of its models in CNG powertrains — the Alto, WagonR, Eeco, Tour S, Eritga, Super Carry, Celerio and S-Presso — and plans to extend it across most of its models. “The consumer is still wary of CNG because of performance and safety issues. We will start a special communication campaign with the customer telling him that our factory fitted CNG vehicles are safe and the performance is good,” Shrivastava said.
He said there no longer existed an economic logic to buying a diesel vehicle. “With diesel costlier than petrol in Delhi and the gap in other cities falling, the preponderance of diesel vehicles in the market will further go down.”
Maruti rival Hyundai is banking on diesel to power growth, particularly in the big sedan and SUV segment.
Hyundai recently launched its premium sedan Elantra with a BS-VI diesel engine, and the company will continue to focus on diesel despite the price hike. A company spokesperson said 47 per cent of the buyers of the new Creta have opted for diesel. The share of diesel is 40 per cent for premium hatchback i20 and 20 per cent in smaller hatchback Grand i10. ",business
Discom dues rise 63%," Power producers’ total outstanding dues owed by distribution firms rose nearly 63 per cent to Rs 1.23 lakh crore in April 2020 over the same month previous year, reflecting stress in the sector.
Distribution companies (discoms) owed a total of Rs 75,642 crore to power generation firms in April 2019, according to portal Praapti (Payment Ratification And Analysis in Power procurement for bringing Transparency in Invoicing of generators).
The portal was launched in May 2018 to bring in transparency in power purchase transactions between the generators and discoms.
In April 2020, the total overdue amount, which was not cleared even after 60 days of grace period offered by generators, stood at Rs 1,08,487 crore against Rs 58,200 crore in the same month of the preceding year. ",business
"FPIs turn net buyers in June, invest Rs 21,235 crore"," Reversing the three-month selling streak in June, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pumped in a net Rs 21,235 crore in domestic markets amid increasing liquidity and gradual opening up of economy.
According to data from depositories, FPIs invested Rs 22,893 crore into equities but pulled out Rs 1,658 crore from the debt segment, taking the total net investment to Rs 21,235 crore between June 1 and June 26.
Prior to this, foreign investors remained net sellers for three consecutive months. They pulled out a net Rs 7,366 crore in May, Rs 15,403 crore in April and a record Rs 1.1 lakh crore in March.
""FPIs are increasing their investments in small- and mid-cap stocks that they were already investing in for over a year now,"" said Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief operating officer at Groww, said.
India has emerged as the best-performing equity market in the past three months and this is certainly adding to India's appeal as an investment destination, he added.
He further said India has done well in contact-tracing of patients, which is helping open up the economy.
""Currently, the valuations are still compressed and equities are attractively priced, which is a good buying opportunity. With a relatively long-term investment horizon, Indian equities could be a good investment option for FPIs especially once the Covid-19 crisis is resolved and the current market trend reverses,"" Himanshu Srivastava, associate director-manager research at Morningstar India, said.
In addition to that, increased liquidity in the global markets will also pave its way into the emerging markets, with India also benefiting, Srivastava added.
The Indian financial markets will continue to witness rotational trend with respect to foreign flows. One can expect bouts of sharp net inflows and outflows by FPIs in the Indian financial markets, depending on their changing opinion and global trends, he said.
Going forward, Srivastava said, ""Globally, the scenario is evolving and there are multiple factors that are dictating the direction of foreign flows."" While the challenges with respect to rising COVID-19 cases and recovery of economic growth remains in India, he said there are certain technical factors that ensure the continuity of foreign flows into the country from time to time.",business
Liquidity window on agenda," The government and Sebi is working on the modalities of a special liquidity window announced as part of the Covid-19 relief package.
In a bid to provide funds to NBFCs, housing finance companies and microfinance institutions that are finding it difficult to raise money from the debt market, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month had announced a Rs 30,000-crore special liquidity window for these institutions. Under this scheme, investments would be made in both the primary and secondary market debt papers of NBFCs, HFIs and MFIs.
Sebi wholetime member G. Mahalingam said on Saturday that with substantial capital support from the government and other stakeholders even bonds rated below AAA may find takers.
The securities will be fully guaranteed by the government.
“The modalities are being worked out and a constant dialogue is on between Sebi and the government to determine how this can be operationalised. While this is going to be a crisis-based window, there is a lot of thought process as to how the secondary markets could be lifted in a way that there are takers even for the bonds which are below,” he said at a webinar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.
“I think it will be worked out in the next few days,” he said. Mahalingam added the regulator has increased the borrowing limit of mutual funds to 40 per cent on a case-to-case basis.
Retail investor
Mahalingam said that in the recent trend of a declining repo rate, depositors would have to accept that interest rates would not be going up any time soon.
“A typical fixed deposit investor who was earning 7-8 per cent earlier can no longer look forward to that kind of a return. He should be getting attuned to a return in the range of 4-5 per cent,” he said.
But investors looking to shift to the capital markets for a better yield would have to do due diligence as well, he added.
New savings bond
New Delhi: The government will introduce new taxable floating rate savings bonds from July 1, offering an opportunity to invest in secured government instruments. The new scheme has been brought in place of the 7.75 per cent savings bonds of 2018, which were withdrawn on May 28, 2020, the finance ministry said.
The interest on the seven-year bond will be paid semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 every year. The interest on January 1, 2021 will be paid at 7.15 per cent. The rate for the next half-year will be reset every six months. PTI",business
Infosys outlook positive for long term," The Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent disruption in economic activities will have a negative impact on Infosys’s business in the near-term, but the medium and long-term outlook is positive as enterprises fast track their digital transformation journey.
This was one of the key messages that the top management of Infosys sent out to its shareholders as the country’s second-largest IT services firm held its 39th annual general meeting (AGM) virtually.
Responding to shareholders queries, they also indicated that Infosys will not be severely affected by the H1-B visa ban brought in by the Donald Trump administration because of its increased localisation initiative over the past 24 months.
Infosys further said that 95 per cent of its 2,40,000 employees was working from home (the peak was 97 per cent) at present and that it was not in a hurry to bring back the work from office model. According to the company, the strategy here will be to proceed in a slow and calibrated manner and the plan is to bring in a hybrid model wherein some employees work from home though this will depend on the nature of the project and client comfort.
Chairman Nandan Nilekani said the investments made over the last few years have positioned the company well and that Infosys has already “pivoted” resources to the new needs of clients and strengthened its expertise in cloud and automation to scale its digital endeavours.",business
Carlyle eyes Piramal pie," US-based Carlyle Group has agreed to buy a 20 per cent stake in the pharmaceutical unit of Piramal Enterprises for about $490 million (Rs 3,700 crore), the companies said on Saturday. Piramal Pharma will use the capital injection to accelerate its organic and inorganic growth plans, the statement said.
The investment comes a month after the private equity firm bought a majority stake in Indian animal healthcare company SeQuent Scientific.
“India is a hugely strategic part of Carlyle’s Asia business, and a market where we continue to see many attractive investment opportunities,” Greg Zeluck, co-head of Carlyle Asia Partners’ advisory team, said.
Reports suggest US private equity firms TA Associates and KKR & Co Inc had also submitting offers for the stake.
The transaction translates into an enterprise value of $2,775 million (Rs 20,904 crore) for the pharma business.
Piramal Enterprises added that there is an upside component of up to $36 million depending on its performance during the current fiscal.
It added that the final amount of equity investment will depend on the net debt, exchange rate and performance against the pre-agreed conditions at the time of closing the deal.
The transaction is expected to close in 2020.
In 2010, Ajay Piramal had sold the pharmaceutical business of Piramal Healthcare for Rs 17,500 crore. Since then he has been gradually scaling up the business, particularly in domestic formulations.
Recently, the pharma solutions business had entered into a pact with G&W Laboratories to acquire its solid oral dosage drug product manufacturing unit at Sellersville in the US for $17.5 million (Rs 130 crore).
The company now has manufacturing capabilities across 13 global facilities and a distribution network in over 100 countries.
Piramal Enterprises told bourses that it will transfer the pharmaceutical business held directly and through its wholly owned subsidiaries to Piramal Pharma, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary.
Carlyle will be investing in this arm.
Speaking to reporters, chairman Ajay Piramal said the pharma business will also be listed in the near future.",business
NBFCs face rating rap," Standard & Poor’s has cut the ratings of four domestic non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Earlier, the agency had downgraded Axis Bank’s credit rating to below investment grade.
The international credit rating agency announced that it was lowering the ratings of Shriram Transport Finance Company Ltd (STFC), Bajaj Finance, Manappuram Finance and Power Finance Corporation Ltd. It, however, reaffirmed the ratings of Muthoot Finance Ltd and Hero FinCorp.
S&P said worsening operating conditions following Covid-19 have increased the risks for financial institutions operating in India.
“We expect a recession to hurt the financial sector. We expect the asset quality of Indian finance companies to deteriorate, credit costs to rise and profitability to decline over the next 12 months. Given the large acceptance of moratorium by borrowers, funding and liquidity problems could worsen for these companies,” the rating agency observed.
Among these NBFCs, the rating of Bajaj Finance and Power Finance has been cut to BB+ from BBB-. In the case of Manappuram, it has been downgraded to B+ from BB-. For Sriram Transport Finance, the rating was cut to BB- from BB.
According to the rating agency, drastic efforts by the Indian government to curtail the spread of coronavirus have resulted in a sharp economic contraction. S&P added that the government’s stimulus package, with a headline amount of 10 per cent of GDP, has about 1.2 per cent of direct stimulus measures, which is low relative to countries with similar economic impact from the pandemic.
The remaining 8.8 per cent of the package includes liquidity support measures and credit guarantees that will not directly support growth.
“We now forecast a 5 per cent contraction in the economy in fiscal 2021. Credit risks remain very high for finance companies in India. We expect the deterioration in NBFCs’ asset quality to intensify as the economy slows amid the pandemic. We expect microfinance to be the most affected by the lockdown and other measures in the fight against Covid-19,” it noted.
S&P observed that the overall impact on finance companies will be more pronounced than banks since some of these companies lend to weaker customers and have high reliance on wholesale funding.
Earlier, S&P had lowered the ratings of Axis Bank, saying that economic risks have increased for banks operating in India. The rating of the private sector lender was downgraded to BB+ from BBB-.
“We lowered our ratings on Axis to reflect our expectation that heightened economic risks facing India’s banking system will affect the bank’s asset quality and financial performance. While Axis’ asset quality is superior to the Indian banking sector average, its level of non-performing assets (NPAs) will likely remain high compared to international peers,” S&P had said.",business
"Petrol price up 25 paise, diesel 21 paise"," Petrol price on Saturday was hiked by 25 paise per litre and diesel by 21 paise, taking the cumulative increase in rates in three weeks to Rs 9.12 and Rs 11.01 respectively.
Petrol price in Delhi was hiked to Rs 80.38 per litre from Rs 80.13, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 80.40 a litre from Rs 80.19, according to a price notification of state oil marketing companies.
Rates have been increased across the country but the final retail selling price differs from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.
In Mumbai, petrol price went up from Rs 86.91 per litre to Rs 87.14, while diesel rate was hiked to Rs 78.71 from Rs 78.51.
While diesel rates have been hiked for the 21st straight day, petrol price has been raised on 20 occasions in three weeks.
The cumulative increase since the oil companies started the cycle on June 7 now totals to Rs 9.12 for petrol and Rs 11.01 for diesel.
On June 7, oil companies had restarted revising prices in line with costs after ending an 82-day hiatus during which they adjusted steep excise duty hikes by the government against the fall in benchmark international oil rates.",business
Market rules for gas," The government is moving towards free market pricing of gas with the current administered price mechanism going against the interest of domestic producers.
Union oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday said India would gradually end government control on pricing and would link them to market forces.
Earlier this month, the country got its own gas trading platform — Indian Gas Exchange — that would help in price discovery of local gas.
The first gas trading exchange will enable local and foreign players such as Shell, Vitol and Trafigura to sell directly to domestic customers.
The gas pricing formula came under fire after the prices were cut a steep 26 per cent to $2.39 per mBtu (million British thermal unit) for a period of six months beginning from April 1.
Oil industry sources said the cut in prices has brought out a lacuna in the formula which does not consider the concerns of domestic producers and their operational viability.
Gas producers have written to the oil ministry offering various suggestions, including the review of the formula that puts domestic producers at a disadvantage over imported LNG.
The ceiling price for gas from difficult fields has also been cut to $5.61 per mBtu from $8.43 per mBtu resulting in a 33.5 per cent fall.
The BJP-led government had in October 2014 adopted a formula that takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK), Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months — on April 1 and October 1 — each year.
BPCL privatisation
Pradhan said there was no going back on the decision to privatise oil marketing company BPCL in view of the slump in global energy prices.
However, the timing of the privatisation would be decided by the finance ministry and not the oil ministry. ",business
 ITC dividend gift," Buoyed by a Rs 1,020-crore tax gain, city-based conglomerate ITC Ltd has declared a hefty dividend of Rs 10.15 a share even as the company’s gross revenue from sales in the fourth quarter dropped because of the outbreak of the pandemic.
Cash outgo on account of the dividend payout would be 80 per cent of ITC’s profit after tax of Rs 15,136 crore for 2019-20. This is in line with the new dividend distribution policy adopted by the company on March 18, a week before the nationwide lockdown, after the Union budget shifted the onus of paying income tax on dividend to the shareholder from the corporate houses.
The company distributed Rs 5.75 a share (of face value Re 1) dividend for 2018-19. ITC’s new dividend payout ratio is now fixed at 80-85 per cent of the profit after tax. Apart from 1.2 million retail shareholders, the high payout would be welcomed in a pandemic year by four state-run insurance companies that together hold a 20.63 per cent stake and foreign tobacco major British American Tobacco (BAT) Plc, which has a 29.48 per cent share.
Revenue down
Gross revenue from sales in the January-March quarter dropped 6.3 per cent to Rs 11,300 crore from Rs 12,064.1 crore a year ago. However, the profit after tax went up 9.1 per cent year-on-year to Rs 3,797 crore from Rs 3,481.9 crore as it migrated to the lower corporate tax regime from the second quarter. ITC booked a Rs 340-crore tax credit in the fourth quarter and Rs 1,020 crore for the whole year.
The post-tax profit for 2019-20 went up 21.4 per cent to Rs 15,136 crore from Rs 12,464 crore, while gross revenue from operations was up 2.4 per cent to Rs 46,323 crore from Rs 45,221 crore.
In the fourth quarter, sales from cigarettes declined 6.5 per cent to Rs 5,130.5 crore from Rs 5,485.9 crore. Edelweiss Research said cigarette volumes declined 10 per cent compared with their expectation of an 8 per cent dip.
The performance of the non-tobacco FMCG segment declined 2.8 per cent, while hotels were down 8.6 per cent in the fourth quarter over the year-ago period.
ITC said the contagion had a significant impact on the hotels and education and stationery products businesses as it coincided with the peak period and the onset of the school season, respectively. ",business
Overseas flight ban till July 15," The ban on all scheduled international commercial passenger service has been extended till July 15, the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said while hinting that there could be a graded resumption of international services .
Late at night, the government announced domestic carriers can operate flights up to 45 per cent of pre-Covid capacity against 30 per cent now.
All scheduled international commercial air passenger services, except for the repatriation flights, will remain suspended July 15, the DGCA said in a circular on Friday.
“However, international scheduled flights may also be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case to case basis,” it added.
The restrictions shall also not apply to international all-cargo flight operations.
The move comes after the Indian government said earlier this week that it was looking at the prospect of establishing bilateral flights for India-US, India-France, India-Germany and India-UK, where demand for travel has not diminished .
Earlier this month, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said India will take a decision on international passenger flights in July depending on the spread of the coronavirus .
80-20 rule
Concerns have grown over holding slots at busy airports such as Heathrow if there are few international flights. The International Air Transport Association has proposed the waiver of the 80-20 use-it-or-leave it rule for slots under which an aviation player must operate at least 80 per cent of flights at an airport.
However, the civil aviation ministry officials provided little clarity on the plans being considered to protect the slots by stating that requisite steps are being taken.",business
IndiGo new scheme: 10% upfront for ticket," In a move to woo flyers, IndiGo has come up with a flexible payment option allowing customers to secure booking on a domestic flight by paying 10 per cent of the ticket price upfront or a minimum Rs 400 per passenger.
Customers will have to pay the balance up to 15 days from date of booking or 15 days before departure, the airline announced. The move will help customers lock in fares and help IndiGo grow bookings. “We intend to extend this offer for our customers to make their travel more comfortable,” said IndiGo’s chief strategy and revenue officer Sanjay Kumar in a press note. ",business
Leg-up to promoters," The relaxation in the method to calculate the price of preferential shares for any issue from July to December will not only help the promoters to raise their holdings but also enable them to raise much needed funds at a time banks have become risk averse.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Thursday offered the option to fix the price of preferential shares based on the average of weekly high or low for two weeks preceding the issue or the price of the preceding twelve weeks, whichever is higher, but the shares will be locked in for a period of three years.
Recently, Sebi allowed promoters to acquire up to 10 per cent of shares of listed companies through preferential allotment without triggering an open offer.
Experts said the move would not only help promoters to fend off hostile takeovers, but also help in fund-raising when such an exercise has become difficult.
Says Lalit Sagar, partner at J Sagar Associates, “Sebi has announced a slew of measures over the past few days aimed at easing fund raising for companies to tide over the Covid crisis.”
The changes must be seen in the context of the amendment in FDI rules in late April that was designed to thwart “opportunistic takeover bids” from China.
“Sebi has indicated leniency to the company promoters and has strengthened the belief that they are outside the ambit of insider trading restrictions when it comes to subscribing shares under preferential allotment mechanism. The recent move will see a spike in such allotments to promoters under this period,” Makarand Joshi of MMJC and Associates said. ",business
Coal India profit down 23%," Subdued demand from the power sector along with lower realisation per tonne from sales impacted the bottomline of Coal India for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020.
The miner has reported a 23 per cent decline in its consolidated net profit at Rs 4,625.16 crore against Rs 6,026.47 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.
Consolidated sales during the January-March quarter dropped to Rs 25,597.43 crore from Rs 26,704.27 crore in the same period of the previous year.
The miner had offered 139.17 million tonnes (mt) of coal during the quarter through the fuel supply agreement (FSA) route at an average realisation of Rs 1,445.75 per tonne. The average realisation on sales of 21.02mt through the e-auction route was Rs 2,105.74 per tonne.

For the quarter ended March 2020, the company produced 213.71 mt of coal against 194.45 mt produced in the January-March quarter of 2018-19. But coal offtake during the March 2020 quarter was almost flat at 163.87 mt against 163.51 mt a year ago.
The firm’s consolidated expenses increased to Rs 22,033.90 crore from Rs 21,471.78 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2018-19.

Emami takes a beating," Wellness focused FMCG firm Emami on Friday reported a 59.4 per cent decline in its March quarter consolidated net profit at Rs 22.75 crore against Rs 56.09 crore a year ago. Revenue from operations was down 16.7 per cent to Rs 532.68 crore from Rs 640.35 crore a year ago.
The business environment that was already facing challenges from weak consumption trends and liquidity concerns was impacted severely by the Covid-19 pandemic, Emami said.
Emami director Harsha V. Agarwal said the company has geared up to respond to the demands of the new normal and has forayed into hand sanitisers, soaps and handwashes under the Boroplus brand and a few other healthcare products under the Zandu brand.
“We are pushing to launch more products in both personal hygiene and healthcare categories in the next one to two months,” he said.
Uco turnaround
Uco Bank has posted a net profit of Rs 16.78 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020 against a net loss of Rs 1,552.03 crore in the corresponding previous period.
A combination of high non-interest income, a fall in NPA and lower provisioning has helped the bottomline of the city-based bank.
“We made quality lending during the quarter and there was also a rise in forex income and treasury profit. There was also a good recovery in written off accounts,” Uco Bank MD and CEO A.K. Goel told The Telegraph.",business
RBI silent on loan recast," The central board of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday discussed the current economic situation and the evolving challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The 583rd meeting came amid a severe hit to the country’s economic growth with banks reluctant to lend amid fears of a spike in bad loans during the second half of this fiscal. Ahead of the meet, there was speculation that the board may discuss changes to the current one-time loan restructuring scheme and also the norms on non-performing assets. Sources, however, said the issue did not figure at the meet.
A statement from the RBI said governor Shaktikanta Das briefed the board members about the impact of the various monetary and regulatory measures taken by the central bank to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.
“At the outset, the governor and deputy governors briefed the board about the overall macroeconomic conditions — both domestic and global; the financial sector situation; and the impact of various monetary, regulatory and other measures taken by the RBI in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the RBI said.
Finance Commission view
The government need not at present focus on fiscal consolidation and increased public debt, rather should concentrate on the fastest possible revival of the economy, the 15th Finance Commission chairman, N K Singh, said on Friday.
He said there is acute pressure on the finances of both the Centre and states given the much lower growth number and revenue receipts. Speaking to reporters after the meeting of the commission with the economic advisory council, Singh said “this year we must not concentrate on the fiscal or debt. We must concentrate on fastest possible revival of the economy”. ",business

Harbhajan’s praise & Rabada’s strategy," Our Bureau, Calcutta: Veteran India spinner Harbhajan Singh has praised the performance by Ambati Rayudu in the opening game of the 13th edition of Indian Premier League and said that he had deserved a spot in the World Cup squad last year.
“The partnership between Rayudu and (Faf) du Plessis was the game-changing moment for Chennai Super Kings. We have made a bright start and we need to keep moving forward like this,” Harbhajan said on a YouTube channel.
  PTI, Dubai: Marcus Stoinis’ all-round brilliance and Kagiso Rabada’s Super Over show helped Delhi Capitals beat Kings XI Punjab after both teams were tied on 157 in regulation time. Asked how he manages to pull off the Super Overs, Rabada said: “It just depends what works for me on the day. There’s decent bounce in this wicket, and the boundaries are quite big. It’ll take a bit to clear it.”

Kings XI Punjab appeal over ‘short run'," Kings XI Punjab have filed an appeal with Match Referee Javagal Srinath over umpire Nitin Menon’s “incorrect” line judgement that resulted in a “short run” call during a crucial phase of their match against Delhi Capitals in Dubai on Sunday.
KXIP lost in the Super Over after the match was tied at the end of 20 overs. The incident happened in the 19th over when Menon — who was stationed at square leg and has recently been included in the ICC Elite panel — ruled KXIP’s Chris Jordan to be one run short though TV replays showed that his bat was well within the crease when he completed the first run.
“We have appealed to the Match Referee saying that such an incident has taken place. You can also say we have informed him of it since nothing much can be done once the match ends.
“I understand this is a human error but it could cost us a playoff berth. This is unfair and we can only hope that the BCCI takes appropriate measures to avoid such things in future,” CEO Satish Menon told The Telegraph on Monday.
KXIP co-owner Ness Wadia was scathing in his assessment.“It is unfortunate that Kings XI were the subject of poor decision making by the umpire and this cost us the game. I do hope that BCCI implements a system and process so that the other teams do not suffer the same plight as Kings XI did...
“If technology is not there to be used for the fairness and transparency of the game and to ensure that it is equitable to all, then why use technology at all,” Wadia said.
According to the rules, the third umpire’s opinion can be sought for a possible dismissal or an unclear boundary. Front foot no-ball calls are also being monitored by the third umpire from this year.
However, there are doubts whether technology can always be considered fool-proof. “The cameras monitoring line calls often show varying results from different angles and cannot be considered conclusive. All these things have to be taken into account before a decision is taken,” said someone in the know of things.
Another co-owner and actress Preity Zinta tweeted: “I travelled enthusiastically during a pandemic,did 6 days of Quarantine & 5covid tests with a smile but that one Short Run hit me hard. What’s the point of technology if it cannot be used? It’s time @BCCI introduces new rules.This cannot happen every year.” Dubai: Marcus Stoinis’ all-round brilliance and Kagiso Rabada’s Super Over show helped Delhi Capitals beat Kings XI Punjab after both teams were tied on 157 in regulation time.
Asked how he manages to pull off the Super Overs, Rabada said: “It just depends what works for me on the day. There’s decent bounce in this wicket, and the boundaries are quite big. It’ll take a bit to clear it.” PTI",sports
"Beyond boundaries, De Villiers plays for Paritosh"," The name is Pant, not Rishabh Pant, but Paritosh Pant. And while he is no cricketer, he is not far away from the game either. Not when he has AB de Villiers dedicating his Twitter and Instagram handles to his name.
So who’s Paritosh Pant? He’s a 29-year-old man who owns a barbecue café in Navi Mumbai that goes by the name of “Too Much Drama” and runs a project — Feeding From Far — through which he has helped feed and distribute ration kits to the poorest and unemployed during the pandemic-induced lockdown.
Before the start of this IPL, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) had announced they would honour the efforts and sacrifices of the Covid-19 warriors with ‘My Covid Heroes’ inscribed on the back of their jerseys while training as wells as during matches.
As part of the RCB-supported campaign by Royal Challenge Sports Drink, De Villiers spoke with Covid-19 warrior Paritosh. And that is how the South African great decided to honour Paritosh and his work.
For Paritosh, the interaction he has had with De Villiers, one of the best batsmen in modern-day cricket, will motivate him to work harder for those hit by the pandemic.
“I spoke to AB earlier this month via video call. To be honest, it was a straightforward conversation, but he was trying to understand everything that we did and heard things in detail,” Paritosh told The Telegraph from Mumbai on Monday.
“He asked me about the challenges I faced and how I reacted to them, and if I had any message to convey. I told him everything that me and the other volunteers did through our project, which is an emergency Covid relief activity in Govandi — a densely populated slum area.
“On hearing everything, he acknowledged that our work has truly been ‘inspiring’ and ‘amazing’. So it does feel nice when someone of AB’s status praises you for your work.” Elaborating on their relief activity, Paritosh added: “The life expectancy in that ward (at Govandi) is just 37-38, so one can only imagine the plight of people there.
“Fortunately, we have been able to raise around Rs 2 crore for this project, out of which, Rs 77,86,040 were crowd-funded. Besides, celebrities such as (singer and composer) Vishal Dadlani, (stand-up comedian) Abish Mathew and (writer, comedian and entrepreneur) Tanmay Bhat have supported us in our project.”
Not just De Villiers, his teammate and captain at RCB, Virat Kohli, has also dedicated his Twitter handle to a Covid-19 warrior. Kohli’s Twitter handle sports Simranjeet Singh’s name.
“In the past few months, whenever I heard the stories of the Covid heroes, it literally gave me goosebumps. These real challengers have made the country proud and inspired all of us to be more persistent and dedicated to our efforts to build a better tomorrow.
“I am truly proud to wear RCB’s ‘My Covid Heroes’ jersey as a sign of solidarity and gratitude to everyone who is right now going the extra mile to support the community at large. They have batted day and night and fought on the field, and I am honoured to call them my heroes,” Kohli had said the other day.
By the way, the cafe that Paritosh owns is run by specially-abled people and one has to place orders through sign languages.
So while De Villiers deals in boundaries and over-boundaries in the IPL, Paritosh has transcended all boundaries to serve humanity.

Owe much to Rohit Sharma: Bumrah," India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah said the freedom he enjoys playing under Rohit Sharma’s captaincy in the Mumbai Indians set-up has been a huge confidence-booster for him in his career.
Bumrah is an integral part of Mumbai Indians, which has won a record four Indian Premier League titles under Rohit’s leadership.
“He (Rohit) has always given me the freedom, he has always told me to express myself, be whatever I want, be it any situation, take ownership of my own bowling, so that gives me a lot of confidence that I’m responsible for whatever I’m doing,” Bumrah said.
“In doing so, a captain gives a bowler so much of confidence. He trusts you so much and he trusts the decisions that you will take and that’s a very positive sign.”
Not just Bumrah, Rohit’s captaincy has also come in for praise from fellow teammates and the Mumbai Indians’ coaching staff.
“He is always open to take suggestions on the ground. In crunch situations he is very calm, cool and composed,” batsman Suryakumar Yadav said in a video posted on the team’s Twitter handle.
While head coach Mahela Jayawardene termed Rohit a “very instinctive leader”, former India speedster Zaheer Khan, who is part of the team’s support staff, described the right-handed batsman as “a thinking cricketer”.
“You have this very relaxed, cool looking guy. His mannerism when he bats, he’s got that elegance, which you can call lazy elegance. But he is very intense and hard-core when it comes to thinking about the game,” Zaheer said.",sports
Hamstrung Royals bank on Steve Smith to tame Chennai Super Kings," Rajasthan Royals will be severely paralysed when they take the field on Tuesday against Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings.
Missing from the Royals’ line-up will be big impact players Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler. Matters could have been even worse for them as there was a question mark on captain Steve Smith’s availability as well. But as of Monday, the Royals it seems will at least have the luxury of having the services of their captain, a champion batsman.
Smith has recovered from a concussion suffered during the England-Australia series and hopes to be back in action on Tuesday.
Royals’ coach Andrew McDonald was understandably elated with Smith’s availability. “Fantastic news that Steve is available. It’s fantastic especially on the back of some setbacks back in the UK. It’s obviously great to have your skipper available for the first game as I’ve said before we are in really good hands.”     
But there’s no such good news regarding Stokes. The English all-rounder is set to miss at least the first half of IPL 2020 as he has to be
with his ailing father in New Zealand. Stokes’ all-round abilities are priceless and it will be difficult for the Royals to fill that gap.
Stokes’ compatriot Buttler will be missing the first game as he arrived in the UAE separately with his family and needs to undergo a 36-hour quarantine period in Dubai.
The Super Kings had appeared somewhat similarly depleted ahead of their first game against the Mumbai Indians, but a resounding victory in that match has put a blanket on all such worries.
Despite missing Suresh Raina, Harbhajan Singh and Dwayne Bravo, Dhoni led his team to a five-wicket win over the defending champions.
For the Royals, Jofra Archer’s presence will be important along with seasoned T20 stars like South African batsman David Miller, Australian pacer Andrew Tye and England all-rounder Tom Curran.
But it is their pool of Indian players who need to inspire confidence. The likes of Sanju Samson, Robin Uthappa, Jaydev Unadkat and Varun Aaron have not really set off fireworks in the IPL sky and the onus will be on them to make an impact.",sports
US Open: Bryson DeChambeau bags 1st Major," Bryson DeChambeau bashed his way to a six-shot US Open victory on Sunday, silencing any lingering questions as to whether his brawny game could translate to the major stage.
World No. 9 DeChambeau, who began the day two shots back of US Open debutant Matthew Wolff, clinched his first Major with a mix of jaw-dropping drives and clutch putts, shooting a virtually flawless three-under-par 67 to reach six under for the tournament.
Wolff (75) was one shot back of DeChambeau at the turn but fell apart over a back nine that included two bogeys and a double-bogey.
Former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen (73) birdied the last to finish alone in third place, a distant eight shots back of DeChambeau and one shot clear of Harris English (73), who made a double-bogey at the first where he lost his tee shot.",sports
Luka Jovic puzzle in Real Madrid draw," Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane stood by his decision to leave $71 million striker Luka Jovic on the bench as his side searched in vain for a goal in their 0-0 draw away to Real Sociedad in their first game of the La Liga season.
The Spanish champions rarely got going in attack as Karim Benzema struggled to combine with teenage wingers Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr, but the coach turned to debutants Marvin and Sergio Arribas from the bench rather than the Serbia striker.
“It was difficult because we could have brought on another striker but that would have changed our shape and I didn’t want to do that, I wanted to improve our wing play by bringing on wide players and that’s what we did,” Zidane said.
Zidane was asked if he had any particular problem with Jovic, who scored 27 goals in the 2018/19 season for Eintracht Frankfurt but only started four times in the league for Real in the last campaign.
“No, we have many players in our squad and I have to pick them and I decided to do what I did,” he said.
“I don’t have anything against any player, it was all about our formation and I didn’t want to change it and Karim was playing well.”
Despite a subdued start to his side’s title defence, Zidane said he was mostly pleased with their performance even though he stressed their need to be more creative in attack and more clinical.
“We lacked a goal threat and a bit of clarity in attack, particularly in the second half, but we played well in the first 40 minutes and overall we should be happy with what we did,” he added.
“We didn’t allow them many chances and we were good in defence but we have to start working now, we know we need to improve in front of goal.
“We always like to go out to win the game so today (Sunday) we feel as though we have lost two points.”                 ",sports
Luis Suarez set for Atletico Madrid," Barcelona’s Luis Suarez has agreed to a deal with the club to end his contract and settled on personal terms with Atletico Madrid, according to reports in Spain on Monday.
The third top scorer of all time was told he was not wanted by new Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman and has been looking for a new club.
Suarez, 33, who has one year to run on his Barcelona contract, agreed a deal with the club to cut it short, reports said. Mundo Deportivo said Suarez has fixed a contract with Atletico Madrid for two seasons, although the club will need to lighten their wage bill to accommodate the Uruguayan.
Reports in Italy say Juventus are in talks with Atletico to re-sign Spain striker Alvaro Morata. Suarez had been heavily linked with Juventus but coach Andrea Pirlo said it was unlikely he would come to Italy because of the difficulty in obtaining an EU passport.",sports
Dele Alli headache for Mourinho," Of the Tottenham Hotspur players impacted by the loan signing of Gareth Bale from Real Madrid, Dele Alli appears the most vulnerable but manager Jose Mourinho has said he will not be sacrificed in the transfer window.
“I want a balanced squad, that’s what I want. He doesn’t need to be sacrificed, but the squad is a puzzle,” Mourinho said when asked about Alli’s future on Sunday. Bale will not be ready to resume his Tottenham career until October as he regains fitness, but when he does it is likely to be in an attacking trio with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.
Alli burst into the spotlight at Tottenham in 2015-16 when he was named PFA Young Player of the Year and made his England debut.  Leicester came from behind to secure a 4-2 home win over Burnley on Sunday which was also a milestone 100th Premier League victory for their manager Brendan Rodgers.    ",sports
Chahal turns it in Royal Challengers Bangalore’s favour," Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) had a lot to smile about on Monday.
Led by their trump card Yuzvendra Chahal (3/18), Virat Kohli and his men turned things around wonderfully to begin their IPL XIII campaign with a 10-run win, as Sunrisers Hyderabad lost eight wickets for just 32, at the Dubai International Stadium.
With Jonny Bairstow (61) well in control and dominating the bowling, Sunrisers were cruising at 121/2 in the 16th over in pursuit of a 164-run target. It was then that Kohli handed over the ball to Chahal, who struck twice in his final over to destabilise Sunrisers. He got Bairstow first, and then followed it up with the scalp of Vijay Shankar, off back-to-back deliveries.
That triggered the Sunrisers’ collapse as after Chahal’s game-changing over, young quick Navdeep Saini (2/25) accounted for Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Rashid Khan in a space of three balls in the 18th over. The rest was formality.
Sunrisers captain David Warner looked good at the start, but an unfortunate run out led to his dismissal. No wonder the pillars of RCB — Kohli and AB de Villiers — were pleased and relieved with their team getting off to a winning start. “Big change for me... For a change, we are on the right side of a close game. We had worked very hard for it,” De Villiers said after the match.
“It’s amazing, to be honest. Last time we were on the other side of the result, losing six (in a row). So nice to be one up.
“We kept our composure and Yuzi (Chahal) came in and completely changed the game for us. Not many spinners got much out of the pitch, but he showed that you can turn it if you have it in your wrists,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.
De Villiers (51) provided RCB with the push at the death that helped them to post a challenging 163/5 after Sunrisers won the toss and opted to bowl. Kohli contributed 14 off 13 balls.
But the man who impressed the most during RCB’s innings was young Devdutt Padikkal (56), scoring a half-century on his IPL debut.  It was a bad day for Sunrisers overall as all-rounder Mitchell Marsh twisted his ankle on the follow through during the fifth over of the RCB innings before hobbling out of the ground.
Marsh, who bowled only four balls, was sent out to bat out of desperation towards the end of the Sunrisers’ innings, but he looked to be writhing in pain.
“It doesn’t look great for Mitch. Hopefully, it isn’t too bad,” Warner said.",sports
